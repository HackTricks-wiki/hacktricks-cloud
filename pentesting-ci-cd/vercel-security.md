  * **Risks:**
    * **Service Denial to Legitimate Users:** Blocking access for valid users or partners.
    * **Operational Disruptions:** Loss of service availability for certain regions or clients.

***

### Secure Compute

**Vercel Secure Compute** enables secure, private connections between Vercel Functions and backend environments (e.g., databases) by establishing isolated networks with dedicated IP addresses. This eliminates the need to expose backend services publicly, enhancing security, compliance, and privacy.

#### **Potential Misconfigurations and Risks**

1. **Incorrect AWS Region Selection**
   * **Misconfiguration:** Choosing an AWS region for the Secure Compute network that doesn't match the backend services' region.

   * **Risk:** Network conflicts leading to failed connections, unauthorized access, or data leakage between networks.
3. **Improper VPC Peering Configuration**
   * **Misconfiguration:** Incorrectly setting up VPC peering (e.g., wrong VPC IDs, incomplete route table updates).
   * **Risk:** Unauthorized access to backend infrastructure, failed secure connections, and potential data breaches.
4. **Excessive Project Assignments**
   * **Misconfiguration:** Assigning multiple projects to a single Secure Compute network without proper isolation.
   * **Risk:** Shared IP exposure increases the attack surface, potentially allowing compromised projects to affect others.
5. **Inadequate IP Address Management**
   * **Misconfiguration:** Failing to manage or rotate dedicated IP addresses appropriately.
   * **Risk:** IP spoofing, tracking vulnerabilities, and potential blacklisting if IPs are associated with malicious activities.
6. **Including Build Containers Unnecessarily**
   * **Misconfiguration:** Adding build containers to the Secure Compute network when backend access isn't required during builds.
   * **Risk:** Expanded attack surface, increased provisioning delays, and unnecessary consumption of network resources.
7. **Failure to Securely Handle Bypass Secrets**
   * **Misconfiguration:** Exposing or mishandling secrets used to bypass deployment protections.
   * **Risk:** Unauthorized access to protected deployments, allowing attackers to manipulate or deploy malicious code.
8. **Ignoring Region Failover Configurations**
   * **Misconfiguration:** Not setting up passive failover regions or misconfiguring failover settings.
   * **Risk:** Service downtime during primary region outages, leading to reduced availability and potential data inconsistency.
9. **Exceeding VPC Peering Connection Limits**
   * **Misconfiguration:** Attempting to establish more VPC peering connections than the allowed limit (e.g., exceeding 50 connections).
   * **Risk:** Inability to connect necessary backend services securely, causing deployment failures and operational disruptions.
10. **Insecure Network Settings**
    * **Misconfiguration:** Weak firewall rules, lack of encryption, or improper network segmentation within the Secure Compute network.
    * **Risk:** Data interception, unauthorized access to backend services, and increased vulnerability to attacks.
