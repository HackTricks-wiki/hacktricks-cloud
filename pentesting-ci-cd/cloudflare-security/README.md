In a Cloudflare account there are some **general settings and services** that can be configured. In this page we are going to **analyze the security related settings of each section:**

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (85).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Websites

Review each with:

{% content-ref url="cloudflare-domains.md" %}
[cloudflare-domains.md](cloudflare-domains.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Domain Registration

* [ ] In **`Transfer Domains`** check that it's not possible to transfer any domain.

Review each with:

{% content-ref url="cloudflare-domains.md" %}
[cloudflare-domains.md](cloudflare-domains.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Analytics

_I couldn't find anything to check for a config security review._

## Pages

On each Cloudflare's page:

* [ ] Check for **sensitive information** in the **`Build log`**.
* [ ] Check for **sensitive information** in the **Github repository** assigned to the pages.
* [ ] Check for potential github repo compromise via **workflow command injection** or **`pull_request_target` ** compromise. More info in the [**Github Security page**](../github-security/).
* [ ] Check for **vulnerable functions** in the `/fuctions` directory (if any), check the **redirects** in the `_redirects` file (if any) and **misconfigured headers** in the `_headers` file (if any).
* [ ] Check for **vulnerabilities** in the **web page** via **blackbox** or **whitebox** if you can **access the code**
* [ ] In the details of each page **** `/<page_id>/pages/view/blocklist/settings/functions`. Check for **sensitive information** in the **`Environment variables`**.
* [ ] In the details page check also the **build command** and **root directory** for **potential injections** to compromise the page.

## **Workers**

On each Cloudflare's worker check:

* [ ] The triggers: What makes the worker trigger? Can a **user send data** that will be **used** by the worker?
* [ ] In the **`Settings`**, check for **`Variables`** containing **sensitive information**
* [ ] Check the **code of the worker** and search for **vulnerabilities** (specially in places where the user can manage the input)
  * Check for SSRFs returning the indicated page that you can control
  * Check XSSs executing JS inside a svg image

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that by default a **Worker is given a URL** such as `<worker-name>.<account>.workers.dev`. The user can set it to a **subdomain** but you can always access it with that **original URL** if you know it.
{% endhint %}

## R2

TODO

## Stream

TODO

## Images

TODO

## Security Center

* [ ] If possible, run a **`Security Insights`** **scan** and an **`Infrastructure`** **scan**, as they will **highlight** interesting information **security** wise.
  * [ ] Just **check this information** for security misconfigurations and interesting info

## Turnstile

TODO

## **Zero Trust**

{% content-ref url="cloudflare-zero-trust-network.md" %}
[cloudflare-zero-trust-network.md](cloudflare-zero-trust-network.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Bulk Redirects

{% hint style="info" %}
Unlike [Dynamic Redirects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/url-forwarding/dynamic-redirects/), [**Bulk Redirects**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/) are essentially static — they do **not support any string replacement** operations or regular expressions. However, you can configure URL redirect parameters that affect their URL matching behavior and their runtime behavior.
{% endhint %}

* [ ] Check that the **expressions** and **requirements** for redirects **make sense**.
* [ ] Check also for **sensitive hidden endpoints** that you contain interesting info.

## Notifications

* [ ] Check the **notifications.** These notifications are recommended for security:
  * `Usage Based Billing`
  * `HTTP DDoS Attack Alert`
  * `Layer 3/4 DDoS Attack Alert`
  * `Advanced HTTP DDoS Attack Alert`
  * `Advanced Layer 3/4 DDoS Attack Alert`
  * `Flow-based Monitoring: Volumetric Attack`
  * `Route Leak Detection Alert`
  * `Access mTLS Certificate Expiration Alert`
  * `SSL for SaaS Custom Hostnames Alert`
  * `Universal SSL Alert`
  * `Script Monitor New Code Change Detection Alert`
  * `Script Monitor New Domain Alert`
  * `Script Monitor New Malicious Domain Alert`
  * `Script Monitor New Malicious Script Alert`
  * `Script Monitor New Malicious URL Alert`
  * `Script Monitor New Scripts Alert`
  * `Script Monitor New Script Exceeds Max URL Length Alert`
  * `Advanced Security Events Alert`
  * `Security Events Alert`
* [ ] Check all the **destinations**, as there could be **sensitive info** (basic http auth) in webhook urls. Make also sure webhook urls use **HTTPS**
  * [ ] As extra check, you could try to **impersonate a cloudflare notification** to a third party, maybe you can somehow **inject something dangerous**

## Manage Account

* [ ] It's possible to see the **last 4 digits of the credit card**, **expiration** time and **billing address** in **`Billing` -> `Payment info`**.
* [ ] It's possible to see the **plan type** used in the account in **`Billing` -> `Subscriptions`**.
* [ ] In **`Members`** it's possible to see all the members of the account and their **role**. Note that if the plan type isn't Enterprise, only 2 roles exist: Administrator and Super Administrator. But if the used **plan is Enterprise**, [**more roles**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account-and-billing/account-setup/account-roles/) can be used to follow the least privilege principle.
  * Therefore, whenever possible is **recommended** to use the **Enterprise plan**.
* [ ] In Members it's possible to check which **members** has **2FA enabled**. **Every** user should have it enabled.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that fortunately the role **`Administrator`** doesn't give permissions to manage memberships (**cannot escalate privs or invite** new members)
