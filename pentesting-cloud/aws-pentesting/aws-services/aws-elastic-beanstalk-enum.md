## Elastic Beanstalk

**Amazon Elastic Beanstalk** is a fully managed service that makes it easy to **deploy, run, and scale web applications** and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, Docker, Tomcat on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.

Elastic Beanstalk provides a simple and flexible way to **deploy your applications to the AWS cloud**, without the need to worry about the underlying infrastructure. It **automatically** handles the details of capacity **provisioning**, load **balancing**, **scaling**, and application health **monitoring**, allowing you to focus on writing and deploying your code.

The infrastructure created by Elastic Beanstalk is managed by **Autoscaling** Groups in **EC2** (with a load balancer). Which means that at the end of the day, if you **compromise the host**, you should know about about EC2:

[aws-ec2-ebs-elb-ssm-vpc-and-vpn-enum](../../aws-security/aws-services/aws-ec2-ebs-elb-ssm-vpc-and-vpn-enum/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Moreover, if Docker is used, it’s possible to use **ECS**.

### Application & Environments

In AWS Elastic Beanstalk, the concepts of an "application" and an "environment" serve different purposes and have distinct roles in the deployment process.

#### Application

* An application in Elastic Beanstalk is a **logical container for your application's source code, environments, and configurations**. It groups together different versions of your application code and allows you to manage them as a single entity.
* When you create an application, you provide a name and descriptio**n, but no resources are provisioned** at this stage. it is simply a way to organize and manage your code and related resources.
* You can have **multiple application versions** within an application. Each version corresponds to a specific release of your code, which can be deployed to one or more environments.

#### Environment

* An environment is a **provisioned instance of your application** running on AWS infrastructure. It is **where your application code is deployed and executed**. Elastic Beanstalk provisions the necessary resources (e.g., EC2 instances, load balancers, auto-scaling groups, databases) based on the environment configuration.
* **Each environment runs a single version of your application**, and you can have multiple environments for different purposes, such as development, testing, staging, and production.
* When you create an environment, you choose a platform (e.g., Java, .NET, Node.js, etc.) and an environment type (e.g., web server or worker). You can also customize the environment configuration to control various aspects of the infrastructure and application settings.

### 2 types of Environments

1. **Web Server Environment**: It is designed to **host and serve web applications and APIs**. These applications typically handle incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests. The web server environment provisions resources such as **EC2 instances, load balancers, and auto-scaling** groups to handle incoming traffic, manage capacity, and ensure the application's high availability.
2. **Worker Environment**: It is designed to process **background tasks**, which are often time-consuming or resource-intensive operations that don't require immediate responses to clients. The worker environment provisions resources like **EC2 instances and auto-scaling groups**, but it **doesn't have a load balancer** since it doesn't handle HTTP/HTTPS requests directly. Instead, it consumes tasks from an **Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue**, which acts as a buffer between the worker environment and the tasks it processes.

### Security

When creating an App in Beanstalk there are 3 very important security options to choose:

* **EC2 key pair**: This will be the **SSH key** that will be able to access the EC2 instances running the app
* **IAM instance profile**: This is the **instance profile** that the instances will have (**IAM privileges**)
  * The autogenerated role is called **`aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role`** and has some interesting access over all ECS, all SQS, DynamoDB elasticbeanstalk and elasticbeanstalk S3 using the AWS managed policies: [AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier), [AWSElasticBeanstalkMulticontainerDocker](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSElasticBeanstalkMulticontainerDocker), [AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier).
* **Service role**: This is the **role that the AWS service** will use to perform all the needed actions. Afaik, a regular AWS user cannot access that role.
  * This role generated by AWS is called **`aws-elasticbeanstalk-service-role`** and uses the AWS managed policies [AWSElasticBeanstalkEnhancedHealth](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSElasticBeanstalkEnhancedHealth) and [AWSElasticBeanstalkManagedUpdatesCustomerRolePolicy](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?region=us-east-1#/roles/details/aws-elasticbeanstalk-service-role?section=permissions)

By default **metadata version 1 is disabled**:

### Exposure

Beanstalk data is stored in a **S3 bucket** with the following name: **`elasticbeanstalk-<region>-<acc-id>`**(if it was created in the AWS console). Inside this bucket you will find the uploaded **source code of the application**.

The **URL** of the created webpage is **`http://<webapp-name>-env.<random>.<region>.elasticbeanstalk.com/`**

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you get **read access** over the bucket, you can **read the source code** and even find **sensitive credentials** on it

if you get **write access** over the bucket, you could **modify the source code** to **compromise** the **IAM role** the application is using next time it's executed.
{% endhint %}

### Enumeration

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
# Find S3 bucket
