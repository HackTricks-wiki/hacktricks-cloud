## IAM

For more information access:

[aws-iam-and-sts-enum.md](../aws-services/aws-iam-and-sts-enum.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Common IAM Persistence

* Create a user
* Add a controlled user to a privileged group
* Create access keys (of the new user or of all users)
* Grant extra permissions to controlled users/groups (attached policies or inline policies)
* Disable MFA / Add you own MFA device
* Create a Role Chain Juggling situation (more on this below in STS persistence)

### Backdoor Role Trust Policies

You could backdoor a trust policy to be able to assume it for an external resource controlled by you (or to everyone):

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "*",
                    "arn:aws:iam::123213123123:root"
                ]
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Backdoor Policy Version

Give Administrator permissions to a policy in not its last version (the last version should looks legit), then assign that version of the policy to a controlled user/group.

### Backdoor / Create Identity Provider

If the account is already trusting a common identity provider (such as Github) the conditions of the trust could be increased so the attacker can abuse them.

## STS

For more information access:

[aws-iam-and-sts-enum.md](../aws-services/aws-iam-and-sts-enum.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Assume role token

Temporary tokens cannot be listed, so maintaining an active temporary token is a way to maintain persistence.

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash">aws sts get-session-token --duration-seconds 129600

# With MFA
aws sts get-session-token \
    --serial-number &#x3C;mfa-device-name> \
    --token-code &#x3C;code-from-token>

# Hardware device name is usually the number from the back of the device, such as GAHT12345678
<strong># SMS device name is the ARN in AWS, such as arn:aws:iam::123456789012:sms-mfa/username
</strong># Vritual device name is the ARN in AWS, such as arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/username
</code></pre>

### Role Chain Juggling

[**Role chaining**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id\_roles\_terms-and-concepts.html#Role%20chaining) is a recognized functionality of AWS useful to maintain stealth persistence. \
As you can **assume role to assume another one to assume the first one (indefinitely)**.&#x20;

When a role is assumed the **expiration field of the credentials is refreshed**. Therefore is **2 roles can assume each other**, it's possible to continuously get new credentials.

You can use this [**tool**](https://github.com/hotnops/AWSRoleJuggler/) to keep the juggling going:

```bash
./aws_role_juggler.py -h
usage: aws_role_juggler.py [-h] [-r ROLE_LIST [ROLE_LIST ...]]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -r ROLE_LIST [ROLE_LIST ...], --role-list ROLE_LIST [ROLE_LIST ...]
```
