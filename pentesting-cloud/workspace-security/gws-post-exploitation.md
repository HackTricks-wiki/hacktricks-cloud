## Google Groups Privesc

By default in workspace a **group** can be **freely accessed** by any member of the organization.\
Workspace also allow to **grant permission to groups** (even GCP permissions), so if groups can be joined and they have extra permissions, an attacker may **abuse that path to escalate privileges**.

You potentially need access to the console to join groups that allow to be joined by anyone in the org. Check groups information in [**https://groups.google.com/all-groups**](https://groups.google.com/all-groups).

### Access Groups Mail info

If you managed to **compromise a google user session**, from [**https://groups.google.com/all-groups**](https://groups.google.com/all-groups) you can see the history of mails sent to the mail groups the user is member of, and you might find **credentials** or other **sensitive data**.

## Takeout - Download Everything Google Knows about an account

If you have a **session inside victims google account** you can download everything Google saves about that account from [**https://takeout.google.com**](https://takeout.google.com/u/1/?pageId=none)

## Vault - Download all the Workspace data of users

If an organization has **Google Vault enabled**, you might be able to access [**https://vault.google.com**](https://vault.google.com/u/1/) and **download** all the **information**.

## Contacts download

From [**https://contacts.google.com**](https://contacts.google.com/u/1/?hl=es\&tab=mC) you can download all the **contacts** of the user.

## Cloudsearch

In [**https://cloudsearch.google.com/**](https://cloudsearch.google.com) you can just search **through all the Workspace content** (email, drive, sites...) a user has access to. Ideal to **quickly find sensitive information**.

## Google Chat

In [**https://mail.google.com/chat**](https://mail.google.com/chat) you can access a Google **Chat**, and you might find sensitive information in the conversations (if any).

## Google Drive Mining

When **sharing** a document you can **specify** the **people** that can access it one by one, **share** it with your **entire company** (**or** with some specific **groups**) by **generating a link**.

When sharing a document, in the advance setting you can also **allow people to search** for this file (by **default** this is **disabled**). However, it's important to note that once users views a document, it's searchable by them.

For sake of simplicity, most of the people will generate and share a link instead of adding the people that can access the document one by one.

Some proposed ways to find all the documents:

* Search in internal chat, forums...
* **Spider** known **documents** searching for **references** to other documents. You can do this within an App Script with[ **PaperChaser**](https://github.com/mandatoryprogrammer/PaperChaser)

## **Keep Notes**

In [**https://keep.google.com/**](https://keep.google.com) you can access the notes of the user, **sensitive** **information** might be saved in here.

### Modify App Scripts

In [**https://script.google.com/**](https://script.google.com/) you can find the APP Scripts of the user.

## **Administrate Workspace**

In [**https://admin.google.com**/](https://admin.google.com), you might be able to modify the Workspace settings of the whole organization if you have enough permissions.

You can also find emails by searching through all the user's invoices in [**https://admin.google.com/ac/emaillogsearch**](https://admin.google.com/ac/emaillogsearch)
