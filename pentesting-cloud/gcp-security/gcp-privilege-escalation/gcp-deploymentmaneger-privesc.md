## deploymentmanager

### `deploymentmanager.deployments.create`

This single permission lets you **launch new deployments** of resources into GCP with arbitrary service accounts. You could for example launch a compute instance with a SA to escalate to it.

You could actually **launch any resource** listed in `gcloud deployment-manager types list`

In the [**original research**](https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/gcp/privilege-escalation-google-cloud-platform-part-1/) following[ **script**](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/GCP-IAM-Privilege-Escalation/blob/master/ExploitScripts/deploymentmanager.deployments.create.py) is used to deploy a compute instance, however that script won't work. Check a script to automate the [**creation, exploit and cleaning of a vuln environment here**](https://github.com/carlospolop/gcp\_privesc\_scripts/blob/main/tests/1-deploymentmanager.deployments.create.sh)**.**

### `deploymentmanager.deployments.update`

This is like the previous abuse but instead of creating a new deployment, you modifies one already existing (so be careful)

Check a script to automate the [**creation, exploit and cleaning of a vuln environment here**](https://github.com/carlospolop/gcp\_privesc\_scripts/blob/main/tests/e-deploymentmanager.deployments.update.sh)**.**

### `deploymentmanager.deployments.setIamPolicy`

This is like the previous abuse but instead of directly creating a new deployment, you first give you that access and then abuses the permission as explained in the previous _deploymentmanager.deployments.create_ section.
