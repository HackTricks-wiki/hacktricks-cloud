## Introduction to GCP Privilege Escalation <a href="#introduction-to-gcp-privilege-escalation" id="introduction-to-gcp-privilege-escalation"></a>

GCP, as any other cloud, have some **principals**: users, groups and service accounts, and some **resources** like compute engine, cloud functions…\
Then, via roles, **permissions are granted to those principals over the resources**. This is the way to specify the permissions a principal has over a resource in GCP.\
There are certain permissions that will allow a user to **get even more permissions** on the resource or third party resources, and that’s what is called **privilege escalation** (also, the exploitation the vulnerabilities to get more permissions).

Therefore, I would like to separate GCP privilege escalation techniques in **2 groups**:

* **Privesc to a principal**: This will allow you to **impersonate another principal**, and therefore act like it with all his permissions. e.g.: Abuse _getAccessToken_ to impersonate a service account.
* **Privesc on the resource**: This will allow you to **get more permissions over the specific resource**. e.g.: you can abuse _setIamPolicy_ permission over cloudfunctions to allow you to trigger the function.
  * Note that some **resources permissions will also allow you to attach an arbitrary service account** to the resource. This means that you will be able to launch a resource with a SA, get into the resource, and **steal the SA token**. Therefore, this will allow to escalate to a principal via a resource escalation. This has happened in several resources previously, but now it’s less frequent (but can still happen).

Obviously, the most interesting privilege escalation techniques are the ones of the **second group** because it will allow you to **get more privileges outside of the resources you already have** some privileges over. However, note that **escalating in resources** may give you also access to **sensitive information** or even to **other principals** (maybe via reading a secret that contains a token of a SA).

{% hint style="warning" %}
It's important to note also that in **GCP Service Accounts are both principals and permissions**, so escalating privileges in a SA will allow you to impersonate it also.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The permissions between parenthesis indicate the permissions needed to exploit the vulnerability with `gcloud`. Those might not be needed if exploiting it through the API.
{% endhint %}

## Permissions for Privilege Escalation Methodology

This is how I **test for specific permissions** to perform specific actions inside GCP.

1. Download the github repo [https://github.com/carlospolop/gcp\_privesc\_scripts](https://github.com/carlospolop/gcp_privesc_scripts)
2. Add in tests/ the new script

## Bypassing access scopes <a href="#bypassing-access-scopes" id="bypassing-access-scopes"></a>

Tokens of SA leakded from GCP metadata service have **access scopes**. These are **restrictions** on the **permissions** that the token has. For example, if the token has the **`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`** scope, it will have **full access** to all GCP services. However, if the token has the **`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform.read-only`** scope, it will only have **read-only access** to all GCP services even if the SA has more permissions in IAM.

There is no direct way to bypass these permissions, but you could always try searching for **new credentials** in the compromised host, **find the service key** to generate an OAuth token without restriction or **jump to a different VM less restricted**.

When [access scopes](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts#accesscopesiam) are used, the OAuth token that is generated for the computing instance (VM) will **have a** [**scope**](https://oauth.net/2/scope/) **limitation included**. However, you might be able to **bypass** this limitation and exploit the permissions the compromised account has.

The **best way to bypass** this restriction is either to **find new credentials** in the compromised host, to **find the service key to generate an OAuth token** without restriction or to **compromise a different VM with a SA less restricted**.

Check SA with keys generated with:

```bash
for i in $(gcloud iam service-accounts list --format="table[no-heading](email)"); do
    echo "Looking for keys for $i:"
    gcloud iam service-accounts keys list --iam-account $i
done
```

## Privilege Escalation Techniques

The way to escalate your privileges in AWS is to have enough permissions to be able to, somehow, access other service account/users/groups privileges. Chaining escalations until you have admin access over the organization.

{% hint style="warning" %}
GCP has **hundreds** (if not thousands) of **permissions** that an entity can be granted. In this book you can find **all the permissions that I know** that you can abuse to **escalate privileges**, but if you **know some path** not mentioned here, **please share it**.
{% endhint %}

**The subpages of this section are ordered by services. You can find on each service different ways to escalate privileges on the services.**

### Abusing GCP to escalate privileges locally

If you are inside a machine in GCP you might be able to abuse permissions to escalate privileges even locally:

[gcp-local-privilege-escalation-ssh-pivoting.md](gcp-local-privilege-escalation-ssh-pivoting.md)
