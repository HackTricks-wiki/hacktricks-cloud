## serviceusage

The following permissions are useful to create and steal API keys, not this from the docs: _An API key is a simple encrypted string that **identifies an application without any principal**. They are useful for accessing **public data anonymously**, and are used to **associate** API requests with your project for quota and **billing**._

Therefore, with an API key you can make that company pay for your use of the API, but you won't be able to escalate privileges.

### `serviceusage.apiKeys.create`

There is another method of authenticating with GCP APIs known as API keys. By default, they are created with no restrictions, which means they have access to the entire GCP project they were created in. We can capitalize on that fact by creating a new API key that may have more privileges than our own user. There is no official API for this, so a custom HTTP request needs to be sent to _https://apikeys.clients6.google.com/_ (or _https://apikeys.googleapis.com/_). This was discovered by monitoring the HTTP requests and responses while browsing the GCP web console. For documentation on the restrictions associated with API keys, visit [this link](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys).

The following screenshot shows how you would create an API key in the web console.

With the undocumented API that was discovered, we can also create API keys through the API itself.

The screenshot above shows a POST request being sent to retrieve a new API key for the project.

The exploit script for this method can be found [here](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/GCP-IAM-Privilege-Escalation/blob/master/ExploitScripts/serviceusage.apiKeys.create.py).

### `serviceusage.apiKeys.list`

Another undocumented API was found for listing API keys that have already been created (this can also be done in the web console). Because you can still see the API key’s value after its creation, we can pull all the API keys in the project.

![](https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image4-1.png)

The screenshot above shows that the request is exactly the same as before, it just is a GET request instead of a POST request. This only shows a single key, but if there were additional keys in the project, those would be listed too.

The exploit script for this method can be found [here](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/GCP-IAM-Privilege-Escalation/blob/master/ExploitScripts/serviceusage.apiKeys.list.py).

### **`serviceusage.services.enable`** , **`serviceusage.services.use`**

With these permissions an attacker can enable and use new services in the project. This could allow an attacker to enable service like admin or cloudidentity to access Workspace information, or other services to access interesting data.&#x20;
