## Storage

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Storage is a **cloud-based storage solution** that provides highly durable and available object storage for unstructured data. It offers **various storage classes** based on performance, availability, and cost, including Standard, Nearline, Coldline, and Archive. GCP Storage also provides advanced features such as **lifecycle policies, versioning, and access control** to manage and secure data effectively.

The bucket can be stored in a region, in 2 regions or **multi-region (default)**.

### Storage Types

* **Standard Storage**: This is the default storage option that **offers high-performance, low-latency access to frequently accessed data**. It is suitable for a wide range of use cases, including serving website content, streaming media, and hosting data analytics pipelines.
* **Nearline Storage**: This storage class offers **lower storage costs** and **slightly higher access costs** than Standard Storage. It is optimized for infrequently accessed data, with a minimum storage duration of 30 days. It is ideal for backup and archival purposes.
* **Coldline Storage**: This storage class is optimized for **long-term storage of infrequently accessed data**, with a minimum storage duration of 90 days. It offers the **lower storage costs** than Nearline Storage, but with **higher access costs.**
* **Archive Storage**: This storage class is designed for cold data that is accessed **very infrequently**, with a minimum storage duration of 365 days. It offers the **lowest storage costs of all GCP storage options** but with the **highest access costs**. It is suitable for long-term retention of data that needs to be stored for compliance or regulatory reasons.
* **Autoclass**: If you **don't know how much you are going to access** the data you can select Autoclass and GCP will **automatically change the type of storage for you to minimize costs**.

### Access Control

By **default** it's **recommended** to control the access via **IAM**, but it's also possible to **enable the use of ACLs**.\
If you select to only use IAM (default) and **90 days passes**, you **won't be able to enable ACLs** for the bucket.

### Versioning

It's possible to enable versioning, this will **save old versions of the file inside the bucket**. It's possible to configure the **number of versions you want to keep** and even **how long** you want **noncurrent** versions (old versions) to live. Recommended is **7 days for Standard type**.

The **metadata of a noncurrent version is kept**. Moreover, **ACLs of noncurrent versions are also kept**, so older versions might have different ACLs from the current version.

Learn more in the [**docs**](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/object-versioning).

### Retention Policy

Indicate how **long** you want to **forbid the deletion of Objects inside the bucket** (very useful for compliance at least).\
Only one of **versioning or retention policy can be enabled at the same time**.

### Encryption

By default objects are **encrypted using Google managed keys**, but you could also use a **key from KMS**.

### Public Access

It's possible to give **external users** (logged in GCP or not) **access to buckets content**.\
By default, when a bucket is created, it will have **disabled the option to expose publicly** the bucket, but with enough permissions the can be changed.

The **format of an URL** to access a bucket is **`https://storage.googleapis.com/<bucket-name>` or `https://<bucket_name>.storage.googleapis.com`** (both are valid).

### HMAC Keys

An HMAC key is a type of _credential_ and can be **associated with a service account or a user account in Cloud Storage**. You use an HMAC key to create _signatures_ which are then included in requests to Cloud Storage. Signatures show that a **given request is authorized by the user or service account**.

HMAC keys have two primary pieces, an _access ID_ and a _secret_.

*   **Access ID**: An alphanumeric string linked to a specific service or user account. When linked to a service account, the string is 61 characters in length, and when linked to a user account, the string is 24 characters in length. The following shows an example of an access ID:

    `GOOGTS7C7FUP3AIRVJTE2BCDKINBTES3HC2GY5CBFJDCQ2SYHV6A6XXVTJFSA`
*   **Secret**: A 40-character Base-64 encoded string that is linked to a specific access ID. A secret is a preshared key that only you and Cloud Storage know. You use your secret to create signatures as part of the authentication process. The following shows an example of a secret:

    `bGoa+V7g/yqDXvKRqq+JTFn4uQZbPiQJo4pf9RzJ`

Both the **access ID and secret uniquely identify an HMAC key**, but the secret is much more sensitive information, because it's used to **create signatures**.

### Enumeration

```bash
# List all storage buckets in project
gsutil ls

# Get each bucket configuration (protections, CLs, times, configs...)
gsutil ls -L

# List contents of a specific bucket
gsutil ls gs://bucket-name/
gsutil ls -r gs://bucket-name/ # Recursive
gsutil ls -a gs://bucket-name/ # Get ALL versions of objects

# Cat the context of a file without copying it locally
gsutil cat 'gs://bucket-name/folder/object'
gsutil cat 'gs://bucket-name/folder/object#<num>' # cat specific version

# Copy an object from the bucket to your local storage for review
gsutil cp gs://bucket-name/folder/object ~/

# List using a raw OAuth token
## Useful because "CLOUDSDK_AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN" and "gcloud config set auth/access_token_file" doesn't work with gsutil
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/<storage-name>/o"
# Download file content from bucket
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/supportstorage-58249/o/flag.txt?alt=media" --output -

# Enumerate HMAC keys
gsutil hmac list

# Get permissions
gcloud storage buckets get-iam-policy gs://bucket-name/
gcloud storage objects get-iam-policy gs://bucket-name/folder/object
```

If you get a permission denied error listing buckets you may still have access to the content. So, now that you know about the name convention of the buckets you can generate a list of possible names and try to access them:

```bash
for i in $(cat wordlist.txt); do gsutil ls -r gs://"$i"; done
```

With permissions `storage.objects.list` and `storage.objects.get`, you should be able to enumerate all folders and files from the bucket in order to download them. You can achieve that with this Python script:

```python
import requests
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def list_bucket_objects(bucket_name, prefix='', marker=None):
    url = f"https://storage.googleapis.com/{bucket_name}?prefix={prefix}"
    if marker:
        url += f"&marker={marker}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    xml_data = response.content
    root = ET.fromstring(xml_data)
    ns = {'ns': 'http://doc.s3.amazonaws.com/2006-03-01'}
    for contents in root.findall('.//ns:Contents', namespaces=ns):
        key = contents.find('ns:Key', namespaces=ns).text
        print(key)
    next_marker = root.find('ns:NextMarker', namespaces=ns)
    if next_marker is not None:
        next_marker_value = next_marker.text
        list_bucket_objects(bucket_name, prefix, next_marker_value)

list_bucket_objects('<storage-name>')
```

### Privilege Escalation
