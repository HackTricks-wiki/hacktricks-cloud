## Basic Methodology

Each cloud has its own peculiarities but in general there are a few **common things a pentester should check** when testing a cloud environment:

* **Benchmark checks**
  * This will help you **understand the size** of the environment and **services used**
  * It will allow you also to find some **quick misconfigurations** as you can perform most of this tests with **automated tools**
* **Services Enumeration**
  * You probably won't find much more misconfigurations here if you performed correctly the benchmark tests, but you might find some that weren't being looked for in the benchmark test.
  * This will allow you to know **what is exactly being used** in the cloud env
  * This will help a lot in the next steps
* **Check Exposed services**
  * This can be done during the previous section, you need to **find out everything that is potentially exposed** to the Internet somehow and how can it be accessed.
    * Here I'm taking **manually exposed infrastructure** like instances with web pages or other ports being exposed, and also about other **cloud managed services that can be configured** to be exposed (such as DBs or buckets)
  * Then you should check **if that resource can be exposed or not** (confidential information? vulnerabilities? misconfigurations in the exposed service?)
* **Check permissions**
  * Here you should **find out all the permissions of each role/user** inside the cloud and how are they used
    * Too **many highly privileged** (control everything) accounts? Generated keys not used?... Most of these check should have been done in the benchmark tests already
    * If the client is using OpenID or SAML or other **federation** you might need to ask them for further **information** about **how is being each role assigned** (it's not the same that the admin role is assigned to 1 user or to 100)
  * It's **not enough to find** which users has **admin** permissions "\*:\*". There are a lot of **other permissions** that depending on the services used can be very **sensitive**.
    * Moreover, there are **potential privesc** ways to follow abusing permissions. All this things should be taken into account and **as much privesc paths as possible** should be reported.
* **Check Integrations**
  * It's highly probably that **integrations with other clouds or SaaS** are being used inside the cloud env.
    * For **integrations of the cloud you are auditing** with other platform you should notify **who has access to (ab)use that integration** and you should ask **how sensitive** is the action being performed.\
      For example, who can write in an AWS bucket where GCP is getting data from (ask how sensitive is the action in GCP treating that data).
    * For **integrations inside the cloud you are auditing** from external platforms, you should ask **who has access externally to (ab)use that integration** and check how is that data being used.\
      For example, if a service is using a Docker image hosted in GCR, you should ask who has access to modify that and which sensitive info and access will get that image when executed inside an AWS cloud.

## Multi-Cloud tools

There are several tools that can be used to test different cloud environments. The installation steps and links are going to be indicated in this section.

### [PurplePanda](https://github.com/carlospolop/purplepanda)

# To run all the checks from the dashboard
steampipe dashboard
# To run all the checks from rhe cli
steampipe check all
```

<details>

<summary>Check all Projects</summary>

In order to check all the projects you need to generate the `gcp.spc` file indicating all the projects to test. You can just follow the indications from the following script

```bash
FILEPATH="/tmp/gcp.spc"
rm -rf "$FILEPATH" 2>/dev/null

# Generate a json like object for each project
for pid in $(gcloud projects list --format="value(projectId)"); do
echo "connection \"gcp_$(echo -n $pid | tr "-" "_" )\" {
    plugin  = \"gcp\"
    project = \"$pid\"
}" >> "$FILEPATH"
done

# Generate the aggragator to call
echo 'connection "gcp_all" {
  plugin      = "gcp" 
  type        = "aggregator"
  connections = ["gcp_*"]
}' >> "$FILEPATH"

echo "Copy $FILEPATH in ~/.steampipe/config/gcp.spc if it was correctly generated"
```

## Google

### GCP

{% content-ref url="gcp-security/" %}
[gcp-security](gcp-security/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Workspace

{% content-ref url="workspace-security.md" %}
[workspace-security.md](workspace-security.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## AWS

{% content-ref url="aws-security/" %}
[aws-security](aws-security/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Azure

Access the portal here: [http://portal.azure.com/](http://portal.azure.com)\
To start the tests you should have access with a user with **Reader permissions over the subscription** and **Global Reader role in AzureAD**. If even in that case you are **not able to access the content of the Storage accounts** you can fix it with the **role Storage Account Contributor**.

It is recommended to **install azure-cli** in a **linux** and **windows** virtual machines (to be able to run powershell and python scripts): [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)\
Then, run `az login` to login. Note the **account information** and **token** will be **saved** inside _\<HOME>/.azure_ (in both Windows and Linux).

Remember that if the **Security Centre Standard Pricing Tier** is being used and **not** the **free** tier, you can **generate** a **CIS compliance scan report** from the azure portal. Go to _Policy & Compliance-> Regulatory Compliance_ (or try to access [https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft\_Azure\_Security/SecurityMenuBlade/22](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft\_Azure\_Security/SecurityMenuBlade/22)).\
\_\_If the company is not paying for a Standard account you may need to review the **CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Benchmark** by "hand" (you can get some help using the following tools). Download it from [**here**](https://www.newnettechnologies.com/cis-benchmark.html?keyword=\&gclid=Cj0KCQjwyPbzBRDsARIsAFh15JYSireQtX57C6XF8cfZU3JVjswtaLFJndC3Hv45YraKpLVDgLqEY6IaAhsZEALw\_wcB#microsoft-azure).

### Run scanners

Run the scanners to look for **vulnerabilities** and **compare** the security measures implemented with **CIS**.

```bash
pip install scout
scout azure --cli --report-dir <output_dir>

#Fix azureaudit.py before launching cs.py
#Adding "j_res = {}" on line 1074
python cs.py -env azure

#Azucar is an Azure security scanner for PowerShell (https://github.com/nccgroup/azucar)
#Run it from its folder
.\Azucar.ps1 -AuthMode Interactive -ForceAuth -ExportTo EXCEL

#Azure-CIS-Scanner,CIS scanner for Azure (https://github.com/kbroughton/azure_cis_scanner)
pip3 install azure-cis-scanner #Install
azscan #Run, login before with `az login`
```

### Attack Graph

[**Stormspotter** ](https://github.com/Azure/Stormspotter)creates an “attack graph” of the resources in an Azure subscription. It enables red teams and pentesters to visualize the attack surface and pivot opportunities within a tenant, and supercharges your defenders to quickly orient and prioritize incident response work.

### More checks

* Check for a **high number of Global Admin** (between 2-4 are recommended). Access it on: [https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft\_AAD\_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft\_AAD\_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview)
* Global admins should have MFA activated. Go to Users and click on Multi-Factor Authentication button.
* Dedicated admin account shouldn't have mailboxes (they can only have mailboxes if they have Office 365).
* Local AD shouldn't be sync with Azure AD if not needed([https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft\_AAD\_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/AzureADConnect](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft\_AAD\_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/AzureADConnect)). And if synced Password Hash Sync should be enabled for reliability. In this case it's disabled:
* **Global Administrators** shouldn't be synced from a local AD. Check if Global Administrators emails uses the domain **onmicrosoft.com**. If not, check the source of the user, the source should be Azure Active Directory, if it comes from Windows Server AD, then report it.
* **Standard tier** is recommended instead of free tier (see the tier being used in _Pricing & Settings_ or in [https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft\_Azure\_Security/SecurityMenuBlade/24](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft\_Azure\_Security/SecurityMenuBlade/24))
*   **Periodic SQL servers scans**:

    _Select the SQL server_ --> _Make sure that 'Advanced data security' is set to 'On'_ --> _Under 'Vulnerability assessment settings', set 'Periodic recurring scans' to 'On', and configure a storage account for storing vulnerability assessment scan results_ --> _Click Save_
* **Lack of App Services restrictions**: Look for "App Services" in Azure ([https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Web%2Fsites](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Web%2Fsites)) and check if anyone is being used. In that case check go through each App checking for "Access Restrictions" and there aren't rules, report it. The access to the app service should be restricted according to the needs.

### Office365

You need **Global Admin** or at least **Global Admin Reader** (but note that Global Admin Reader is a little bit limited). However, those limitations appear in some PS modules and can be bypassed accessing the features via the web application.
