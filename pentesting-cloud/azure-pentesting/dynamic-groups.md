## Basic Information

**Dynamic groups** are groups that has a set of **rules** configured and all the **users or devices** that match the rules are added to the group. Every time a user or device **attribute** is **changed**, dynamic rules are **rechecked**. And when a **new rule** is **created** all devices and users are **checked**.

Dynamic groups can have **Azure RBAC roles assigned** to them, but it's **not possible** to add **AzureAD roles** to dynamic groups.

This feature requires Azure AD premium P1 license.

## Privesc

Note that by default any user can invite guests in Azure AD, so, If a dynamic group **rule** gives **permissions** to users based on **attributes** that can be **set** in a new **guest**, it's possible to **create a guest** with this attributes and **escalate privileges**. It's also possible for a guest to manage his own profile and change these attributes.

Get groups that allow Dynamic membership: `Get-AzureADMSGroup | ?{$_.GroupTypes -eq 'DynamicMembership'}`

### Example

* **Rule example**: `(user.otherMails -any (_ -contains "tester")) -and (user.userType -eq "guest")`
* **Rule description**: Any Guest user whose secondary email contains the string 'tester' will be added to the group

1. Go to **Azure Active Directory** -> **Users** and **click** on `Want to switch back to the legacy users list experience? Click here to leave the preview`
2. Click on **`New guest user`** and **invite** an email
3. The **user's profile** will be **added** to the Azure AD as soon as the invite is sent. Open the user's profile and **click on (manage) under Invitation accepted**.

4. Change **`Resend invite?`** to **Yes** and you will get an invitation URL:
   * ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (11) (1).png>)
5. Copy the **URL** and **open** it, **login** as the invited user and **accept** the invitation
6.  **Login** in the cli as the user and set the secondary email

    $creds = New-Object
    System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('externaltester@somedomain.onmicrosoft.com', $Password)
    Connect-AzureAD -Credential $creds -TenantId <tenant_id_of_attacked_domain>

    # Chnage OtherMails setting
