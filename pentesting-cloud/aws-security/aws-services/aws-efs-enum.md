## EFS

### Basic Information

Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is presented as a **fully managed, scalable, and elastic network file system** by AWS. The service facilitates the creation and configuration of **file systems** that can be concurrently accessed by multiple EC2 instances and other AWS services. The key features of EFS include its ability to automatically scale without manual intervention, provision low-latency access, support high-throughput workloads, guarantee data durability, and seamlessly integrate with various AWS security mechanisms.

By **default**, the EFS folder to mount will be **`/`** but it could have a **different name**.

### Network Access

An EFS is created in a VPC and would be **by default accessible in all the VPC subnetworks**. However, the EFS will have a Security Group. In order to **give access to an EC2** (or any other AWS service) to mount the EFS, it’s needed to **allow in the EFS security group an inbound NFS** (2049 port) **rule from the EC2 Security Group**.

Without this, you **won't be able to contact the NFS service**.

For more information about how to do this check: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38632222/aws-efs-connection-timeout-at-mount](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38632222/aws-efs-connection-timeout-at-mount)

### Enumeration

```bash
# Get filesystems and access policies (if any)
aws efs describe-file-systems
aws efs describe-file-system-policy --file-system-id <id>

# Get subnetworks and IP addresses where you can find the file system
aws efs describe-mount-targets --file-system-id <id>
aws efs describe-mount-target-security-groups --mount-target-id <id>
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <sg_id>

# Get other access points
aws efs describe-access-points

# Get replication configurations
aws efs describe-replication-configurations

# Search for NFS in EC2 networks
sudo nmap -T4 -Pn -p 2049 --open 10.10.10.0/20 # or /16 to be sure
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
It might be that the EFS mount point is inside the same VPC but in a different subnet. If you want to be sure you find all **EFS points it would be better to scan the `/16` netmask**.
{% endhint %}

### Mount EFS

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
sudo mkdir /efs

## Mount found
sudo apt install nfs-common
sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport <IP>:/ /efs

## Mount with efs type
## You need to have installed the package amazon-efs-utils
sudo yum install amazon-efs-utils # If centos
sudo apt-get install amazon-efs-utils # If ubuntu
sudo mount -t efs <file-system-id/EFS DNS name>:/ /efs/
```
{% endcode %}

### IAM Access

By **default** anyone with **network access to the EFS** will be able to mount, **read and write it even as root user**. However, File System policies could be in place **only allowing principals with specific permissions** to access it.\
For example, this File System policy **won't allow even to mount** the file system if you **don't have the IAM permission**:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "efs-policy-wizard-2ca2ba76-5d83-40be-8557-8f6c19eaa797",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "efs-statement-e7f4b04c-ad75-4a7f-a316-4e5d12f0dbf5",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "*"
            },
            "Action": "",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:elasticfilesystem:us-east-1:318142138553:file-system/fs-0ab66ad201b58a018",
            "Condition": {
                "Bool": {
                    "elasticfilesystem:AccessedViaMountTarget": "true"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Or this will **prevent anonymous access**:

Note that to mount file systems protected by IAM you MUST use the type "efs" in the mount command:

```bash
sudo mkdir /efs
sudo mount -t efs -o tls,iam  <file-system-id/EFS DNS name>:/ /efs/
# To use a different pforile from ~/.aws/credentials
# You can use: -o tls,iam,awsprofile=namedprofile
```

### Access Points

**Access points** are **application**-specific entry points **into an EFS file system** that make it easier to manage application access to shared datasets.

When you create an access point, you can **specify the owner and POSIX permissions** for the files and directories created through the access point. You can also **define a custom root directory** for the access point, either by specifying an existing directory or by creating a new one with the desired permissions. This allows you to **control access to your EFS file system on a per-application or per-user basis**, making it easier to manage and secure your shared file data.

**You can mount the File System from an access point with something like:**

```bash
# Use IAM if you need to use iam permissions
sudo mount -t efs -o tls,[iam],accesspoint=<access-point-id> \
    <file-system-id/EFS DNS> /efs/
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that even trying to mount an access point you still need to be able to **contact the NFS service via network**, and if the EFS has a file system **policy**, you need **enough IAM permissions** to mount it.
{% endhint %}

Access points can be used for the following purposes:

* **Simplify permissions management**: By defining a POSIX user and group for each access point, you can easily manage access permissions for different applications or users without modifying the underlying file system's permissions.
* **Enforce a root directory**: Access points can restrict access to a specific directory within the EFS file system, ensuring that each application or user operates within its designated folder. This helps prevent accidental data exposure or modification.
* **Easier file system access**: Access points can be associated with an AWS Lambda function or an AWS Fargate task, simplifying file system access for serverless and containerized applications.
