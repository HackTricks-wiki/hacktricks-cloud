## Types of services

### Container services

Services that fall under container services have the following characteristics:

* The service itself runs on **separate infrastructure instances**, such as EC2.
* **AWS** is responsible for **managing the operating system and the platform**.
* A managed service is provided by AWS, which is typically the service itself for the **actual application which are seen as containers**.
* As a user of these container services, you have a number of management and security responsibilities, including **managing network access security, such as network access control list rules and any firewalls**.
* Also, platform-level identity and access management where it exists.
* **Examples** of AWS container services include Relational Database Service, Elastic Mapreduce, and Elastic Beanstalk.

### Abstract Services

* These services are **removed, abstracted, from the platform or management layer which cloud applications are built on**.
* The services are accessed via endpoints using AWS application programming interfaces, APIs.
* The **underlying infrastructure, operating system, and platform is managed by AWS**.
* The abstracted services provide a multi-tenancy platform on which the underlying infrastructure is shared.
* **Data is isolated via security mechanisms**.
* Abstract services have a strong integration with IAM, and **examples** of abstract services include S3, DynamoDB, Amazon Glacier, and SQS.
