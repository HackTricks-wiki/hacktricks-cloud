## CloudWatch

**CloudWatch** **collects** monitoring and operational **data** in the form of logs/metrics/events providing a **unified view of AWS resources**, applications and services.\
CloudWatch Log Event have a **size limitation of 256KB on each log line**.\
It can set **high resolution alarms**, visualize **logs** and **metrics** side by side, take automated actions, troubleshoot issues, and discover insights to optimize applications.

You can monitor for example logs from CloudTrail. Events that are monitored:

* Changes to Security Groups and NACLs
* Starting, Stopping, rebooting and terminating EC2 instances
* Changes to Security Policies within IAM and S3
* Failed login attempts to the AWS Management Console
* API calls that resulted in failed authorization
* Filters to search in cloudwatch: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/FilterAndPatternSyntax.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/FilterAndPatternSyntax.html)

### CloudWatch Logs <a href="#cloudwatch-logs" id="cloudwatch-logs"></a>

Allows to **aggregate and monitor logs from applications** and systems from **AWS services** (including CloudTrail) and **from apps/systems** (**CloudWatch Agen**t can be installed on a host). Logs can be **stored indefinitely** (depending on the Log Group settings) and can be exported.

**Elements**:

| **Log Group**            | A **collection of log streams** that share the same retention, monitoring, and access control settings                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Log Stream**           | A sequence of **log events** that share the **same source**                                                                                                |
| **Subscription Filters** | Define a **filter pattern that matches events** in a particular log group, send them to Kinesis Data Firehose stream, Kinesis stream, or a Lambda function |

### CloudWatch Monitoring & Events

CloudWatch **basic** aggregates data **every 5min** (the **detailed** one does that **every 1 min**). After the aggregation, it **checks the thresholds of the alarms** in case it needs to trigger one.\
In that case, CLoudWatch can be prepared to send an event and perform some automatic actions (AWS lambda functions, SNS topics, SQS queues, Kinesis Streams)

### Agent Installation

You can install agents inside your machines/containers to automatically send the logs back to CloudWatch.

* **Create** a **role** and **attach** it to the **instance** with permissions allowing CloudWatch to collect data from the instances in addition to interacting with AWS systems manager SSM (CloudWatchAgentAdminPolicy & AmazonEC2RoleforSSM)
* **Download** and **install** the **agent** onto the EC2 instance ([https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazoncloudwatch-agent/linux/amd64/latest/AmazonCloudWatchAgent.zip](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazoncloudwatch-agent/linux/amd64/latest/AmazonCloudWatchAgent.zip)). You can download it from inside the EC2 or install it automatically using AWS System Manager selecting the package AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage
* **Configure** and **start** the CloudWatch Agent

A log group has many streams. A stream has many events. And inside of each stream, the events are guaranteed to be in order.

## Actions

### Enumeration

```bash
# Dashboards
aws cloudwatch list-dashboards
aws cloudwatch get-dashboard --dashboard-name <dashboard_name>

# Alarms
aws cloudwatch describe-alarms
aws cloudwatch describe-alarm-history
aws cloudwatch describe-alarms-for-metric --metric-name <metric_name> --namespace <namespace>
aws cloudwatch describe-alarms-for-metric --metric-name IncomingLogEvents --namespace AWS/Logs

# Anomaly Detections
aws cloudwatch describe-anomaly-detectors
aws cloudwatch describe-insight-rules

# Logs
aws logs tail "<log_group_name>" --follow
aws logs get-log-events --log-group-name "<log_group_name>" --log-stream-name "<log_stream_name>" --output text > <output_file>

# Events enumeration
aws events list-rules
aws events describe-rule --name <name>
aws events list-targets-by-rule --rule <name>
aws events list-archives
aws events describe-archive --archive-name <name>
aws events list-connections
aws events describe-connection --name <name>
aws events list-endpoints
aws events describe-endpoint --name <name>
aws events list-event-sources
aws events describe-event-source --name <name>
aws events list-replays
aws events list-api-destinations
aws events list-event-buses
```

## Avoid Detection

### `event:ListRules`, `event:ListTargetsByRule`, `event:PutRule`, `event:RemoveTargets`

GuardDuty populates its findings to Cloudwatch Events on a 5 minute cadence. Modifying the Event pattern or Targets for an event **may reduce GuardDuty's ability to alert and trigger auto-remediation of findings**, especially where the remediation is triggered in a member account as GuardDuty administrator protections do not extend to the Cloudwatch events in the member account.

{% hint style="info" %}
In a delegated or invitational admin GuardDuty architecture, cloudwatch events will still be created in the admin account.
{% endhint %}

```bash
# Disable GuardDuty Cloudwatch Event
aws events put-rule --name guardduty-event \
--event-pattern "{\"source\":[\"aws.guardduty\"]}" \
--state DISABLED

# Modify Event Pattern
aws events put-rule --name guardduty-event \
--event-pattern '{"source": ["aws.somethingthatdoesntexist"]}'

# Remove Event Targets
aws events remove-targets --name guardduty-event \
--ids "GuardDutyTarget"
```
