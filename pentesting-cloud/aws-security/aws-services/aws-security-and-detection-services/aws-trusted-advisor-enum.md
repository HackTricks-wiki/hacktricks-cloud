# AWS Trusted Advisor Overview

Trusted Advisor is a service that **provides recommendations** to optimize your AWS account, aligning with **AWS best practices**. It's a service that operates across multiple regions. Trusted Advisor offers insights in four primary categories:

1. **Cost Optimization:** Suggests how to restructure resources to reduce expenses.
2. **Performance:** Identifies potential performance bottlenecks.
3. **Security:** Scans for vulnerabilities or weak security configurations.
4. **Fault Tolerance:** Recommends practices to enhance service resilience and fault tolerance.

The comprehensive features of Trusted Advisor are exclusively accessible with **AWS business or enterprise support plans**. Without these plans, access is limited to **six core checks**, primarily focused on performance and security.

## Notifications and Data Refresh
