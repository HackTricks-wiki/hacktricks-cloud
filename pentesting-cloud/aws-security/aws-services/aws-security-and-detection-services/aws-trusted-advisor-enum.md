# AWS Trusted Advisor Overview

Trusted Advisor is a service that **provides recommendations** to optimize your AWS account, aligning with **AWS best practices**. It's a service that operates across multiple regions. Trusted Advisor offers insights in four primary categories:

1. **Cost Optimization:** Suggests how to restructure resources to reduce expenses.
2. **Performance:** Identifies potential performance bottlenecks.
3. **Security:** Scans for vulnerabilities or weak security configurations.
4. **Fault Tolerance:** Recommends practices to enhance service resilience and fault tolerance.

The comprehensive features of Trusted Advisor are exclusively accessible with **AWS business or enterprise support plans**. Without these plans, access is limited to **six core checks**, primarily focused on performance and security.

## Notifications and Data Refresh

- Trusted Advisor can issue alerts.
- Items can be excluded from its checks.
- Data is refreshed every 24 hours. However, a manual refresh is possible 5 minutes after the last refresh.

## **Checks Breakdown**

### CategoriesCore

1. Cost Optimization
2. Security
3. Fault Tolerance
4. Performance
5. Service Limits
6. S3 Bucket Permissions

### Core Checks

Limited to users without business or enterprise support plans:

1. Security Groups - Specific Ports Unrestricted
2. IAM Use
3. MFA on Root Account

- MFA enabled on root account
- RDS security group permissiveness
- CloudTrail usage
