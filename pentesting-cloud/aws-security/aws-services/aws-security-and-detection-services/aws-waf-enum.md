## WAF

AWS WAF is a **web application firewall** that helps **protect your web applications** or APIs against common web exploits that may affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. AWS WAF gives you control over **how traffic reaches your applications** by enabling you to create **security rules that block common attack patterns**, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting, and rules that filter out specific traffic patterns you define.

### Conditions

Conditions allow you to specify **what elements of the incoming HTTP or HTTPS request you want WAF to be monitoring** (XSS, GEO - filtering by location-, IP address, Size constraints, SQL Injection attacks, strings and regex matching). Note that if you are restricting a country from cloudfront, this request won't arrive to the waf.

You can have **100 conditions of each type**, such as Geo Match or size constraints, however **Regex** is the **exception** to this rule where **only 10 Regex** conditions are allowed but this limit is possible to increase. You are able to have **100 rules and 50 Web ACLs per AWS account**. You are limited to **5 rate-based-rules** per account. Finally you can have **10,000 requests per second** when **using WAF** within your application load balancer.

### Rules

Using these conditions you can create rules: For example, block request if 2 conditions are met.\
When creating your rule you will be asked to select a **Rule Type**: **Regular Rule** or **Rate-Based Rule**.

The only **difference** between a rate-based rule and a regular rule is that **rate-based** rules **count** the **number** of **requests** that are being received from a particular IP address over a time period of **five minutes**.

When you select a rate-based rule option, you are asked to **enter the maximum number of requests from a single IP within a five minute time frame**. When the count limit is **reached**, **all other requests from that same IP address is then blocked**. If the request rate falls back below the rate limit specified the traffic is then allowed to pass through and is no longer blocked. When setting your rate limit it **must be set to a value above 2000**. Any request under this limit is considered a Regular Rule.

### Actions

An action is applied to each rule, these actions can either be **Allow**, **Block** or **Count**.

* When a request is **allowed**, it is **forwarded** onto the relevant CloudFront distribution or Application Load Balancer.
* When a request is **blocked**, the request is **terminated** there and no further processing of that request is taken.
* A **Count** action will **count the number of requests that meet the conditions** within that rule. This is a really good option to select when testing the rules to ensure that the rule is picking up the requests as expected before setting it to either Allow or Block.

If an **incoming request does not meet any rule** within the Web ACL then the request takes the action associated to a **default action** specified which can either be **Allow** or **Block**. An important point to make about these rules is that they are **executed in the order that they are listed within a Web ACL**. So be careful to architect this order correctly for your rule base, **typically** these are **ordered** as shown:

1. WhiteListed IPs as Allow.
2. BlackListed IPs Block
3. Any Bad Signatures also as Block.

### CloudWatch

WAF CloudWatch metrics are reported **in one minute intervals by default** and are kept for a two week period. The metrics monitored are AllowedRequests, BlockedRequests, CountedRequests, and PassedRequests.

## Enumeration

scope can also be CLOUDFRONT, but when checking for a WAF not related to CLoudfront you need to use REGIONAL.

```
# Get web acls
aws wafv2 list-web-acls --scope REGIONAL
aws wafv2 get-web-acl --scope REGIONAL --name <name> --id <id>
aws wafv2 list-resources-for-web-acl --web-acl-arn <web-acl-arn> #Resources associated with the ACL
aws wafv2 get-web-acl-for-resource --resource-arn <arn> # Get web acl of the resource

# Rule groups
aws wafv2 list-rule-groups --scope REGIONAL
aws wafv2 get-rule-group --scope REGIONAL --name <name> --id <id>

# Get IP sets
aws wafv2 list-ip-sets --scope=REGIONAL
aws wafv2 get-ip-set --scope=REGIONAL --name <name> --id <id>

# Get regex patterns
aws wafv2 list-regex-pattern-sets --scope REGIONAL

# Get logging config (buckets storing the logs)
aws wafv2 list-logging-configurations --scope=REGIONAL
```

## Post Exploitation / Bypass

{% hint style="success" %}
From an attackers perspective, this service can help the attacker to identify WAF protections and network exposures that could help him to compromise other webs.

However, an attacker could also be interested in disrupting this service so the webs aren't protected by the WAF.
