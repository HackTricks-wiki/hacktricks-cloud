## Enumerate Roles & Usernames in an account

### ~~Assume Role Brute-Force~~

{% hint style="danger" %}
**This technique doesn't work** anymore as if the role exists or not you always get this error:

`An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the AssumeRole operation: User: arn:aws:iam::947247140022:user/testenv is not authorized to perform: sts:AssumeRole on resource: arn:aws:iam::429217632764:role/account-balanceasdas`

You can **test this running**:

`aws sts assume-role --role-arn arn:aws:iam::412345678909:role/superadmin --role-session-name s3-access-example`
{% endhint %}

If you try to **assume a role that you don’t have permissions to**, AWS will output an error similar to:

```
An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the AssumeRole operation: User: arn:aws:iam::012345678901:user/MyUser is not authorized to perform: sts:AssumeRole on resource: arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/aws-service-role/rds.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForRDS
```

This error message indicates that the role exists, but its assume role policy document does not allow you to assume it. By running the same command, but targeting **a role that does not exist**, AWS will return:

```
An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the AssumeRole operation: Not authorized to perform sts:AssumeRole
```

Surprisingly, **this process works cross-account**. Given any valid AWS account ID and a well-tailored wordlist, you can enumerate the account’s existing roles without restrictions.

You can use this [script to enumerate potential principals](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/Security-Research/tree/master/tools/aws-pentest-tools/assume\_role\_enum) abusing this issue.

### Trust Policies: Brute-Force Cross Account roles and users

When setting up/update an **IAM role trust policy**, you are specifying what **AWS resources/services can assume that role** and gain temporary credentials.

When you save the policy, if the resource is **found**, the trust policy will **save successfully**, but if it is **not found**, then an **error will be thrown**, indicating an invalid principal was supplied.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that in that resource you could specify a cross account role or user:

* `arn:aws:iam::acc_id:role/role_name`
* `arn:aws:iam::acc_id:user/user_name`
{% endhint %}

This is a policy example:

```json
{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement":[
    {
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Principal":
      {
        "AWS":"arn:aws:iam::216825089941:role\/Test"
      },
    "Action":"sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### GUI

That is the **error** you will find if you uses a **role that doesn't exist**. If the role **exist**, the policy will be **saved** without any errors. (The error is for update, but it also works when creating)

#### CLI

```bash
### You could also use: aws iam update-assume-role-policy
# When it works
aws iam create-role --role-name Test-Role --assume-role-policy-document file://a.json
{
    "Role": {
        "Path": "/",
        "RoleName": "Test-Role",
        "RoleId": "AROA5ZDCUJS3DVEIYOB73",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::947247140022:role/Test-Role",
        "CreateDate": "2022-05-03T20:50:04Z",
        "AssumeRolePolicyDocument": {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                {
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Principal": {
                        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::316584767888:role/account-balance"
                    },
                    "Action": [
                        "sts:AssumeRole"
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}

# When it doesn't work
aws iam create-role --role-name Test-Role2 --assume-role-policy-document file://a.json
An error occurred (MalformedPolicyDocument) when calling the CreateRole operation: Invalid principal in policy: "AWS":"arn:aws:iam::316584767888:role/account-balanceefd23f2"
```

You can automate this process with [https://github.com/carlospolop/aws\_tools](https://github.com/carlospolop/aws\_tools)

* `bash unauth_iam.sh -t user -i 316584767888 -r TestRole -w ./unauth_wordlist.txt`

Our using [Pacu](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/pacu):

* `run iam__enum_users --role-name admin --account-id 229736458923 --word-list /tmp/names.txt`
* `run iam__enum_roles --role-name admin --account-id 229736458923 --word-list /tmp/names.txt`
* The `admin` role used in the example is a **role in your account to by impersonated** by pacu to create the policies it needs to create for the enumeration

### Privesc

In the case the role was bad configured an allows anyone to assume it:

The attacker could just assume it.
