### API Invoke bypass

According to the talk [Attack Vectors for APIs Using AWS API Gateway Lambda Authorizers - Alexandre & Leonardo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsPKk7WDOnE), Lambda Authorizers can be configured **using IAM syntax** to give permissions to invoke API endpoints. This is taken [**from the docs**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-control-access-using-iam-policies-to-invoke-api.html):

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Permission",
      "Action": [
        "execute-api:Execution-operation"           
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:execute-api:region:account-id:api-id/stage/METHOD_HTTP_VERB/Resource-path"
      ]
    }
  ]
} 
```

The problem with this way to give permissions to invoke endpoints is that the **"\*" implies "anything"** and there is **no more regex syntax supported**.

Some examples:

* A rule such as `arn:aws:execute-apis:sa-east-1:accid:api-id/prod/*/dashboard/*` in order to give each user access to `/dashboard/user/{username}` will give them access to other routes such as `/admin/dashboard/createAdmin` for example.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that **"\*" doesn't stop expanding with slashes**, therefore, if you use "\*" in api-id for example, it could also indicate "any stage" or "any method" as long as the final regex is still valid.\
So `arn:aws:execute-apis:sa-east-1:accid:*/prod/GET/dashboard/*`\
Can validate a post request to test stage to the path `/prod/GET/dashboard/admin` for example.
{% endhint %}

You should always have clear what you want to allow to access and then check if other scenarios are possible with the permissions granted.

For more info, apart of the [**docs**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-control-access-using-iam-policies-to-invoke-api.html), you can find code to implement authorizers in [**this official aws github**](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-apigateway-lambda-authorizer-blueprints/tree/master/blueprints).

### IAM Policy Injection

In the same [**talk** ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsPKk7WDOnE)it's exposed the fact that if the code is using **user input** to **generate the IAM policies**, wildcards (and others such as "." or specific strings) can be included in there with the goal of **bypassing restrictions**.

### Public URL template

```
https://{random_id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/{user_provided}
```

### Get Account ID from public API Gateway URL

Just like with S3 buckets, Data Exchange and Lambda URLs gateways, It's possible to find the account ID of an account abusing the **`aws:ResourceAccount`** **Policy Condition Key** from a public API Gateway URL. This is done by finding the account ID one character at a time abusing wildcards in the **`aws:ResourceAccount`** section of the policy.\
This technique also allows to get **values of tags** if you know the tag key (there some default interesting ones).

You can find more information in the [**original research**](https://blog.plerion.com/conditional-love-for-aws-metadata-enumeration/) and the tool [**conditional-love**](https://github.com/plerionhq/conditional-love/) to automate this exploitation.
