### API Invoke bypass

According to the talk [Attack Vectors for APIs Using AWS API Gateway Lambda Authorizers - Alexandre & Leonardo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsPKk7WDOnE), Lambda Authorizers can be configured **using IAM syntax** to give permissions to invoke API endpoints. This is taken [**from the docs**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-control-access-using-iam-policies-to-invoke-api.html):

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Permission",
      "Action": [
        "execute-api:Execution-operation"           
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:execute-api:region:account-id:api-id/stage/METHOD_HTTP_VERB/Resource-path"
      ]
    }
  ]
} 
```

The problem with this way to give permissions to invoke endpoints is that the **"\*" implies "anything"** and there is **no more regex syntax supported**.

Some examples:

* A rule such as `arn:aws:execute-apis:sa-east-1:accid:api-id/prod/*/dashboard/*` in order to give each user access to `/dashboard/user/{username}` will give them access to other routes such as `/admin/dashboard/createAdmin` for example.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that **"\*" doesn't stop expanding with slashes**, therefore, if you use "\*" in api-id for example, it could also indicate "any stage" or "any method" as long as the final regex is still valid.\
So `arn:aws:execute-apis:sa-east-1:accid:*/prod/GET/dashboard/*`\
Can validate a post request to test stage to the path `/prod/GET/dashboard/admin` for example.
{% endhint %}

You should always have clear what you want to allow to access and then check if other scenarios are possible with the permissions granted.

For more info, apart of the [**docs**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-control-access-using-iam-policies-to-invoke-api.html), you can find code to implement authorizers in [**this official aws github**](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-apigateway-lambda-authorizer-blueprints/tree/master/blueprints).

### IAM Policy Injection

In the same [**talk** ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsPKk7WDOnE)it's exposed the fact that if the code is using **user input** to **generate the IAM policies**, wildcards (and others such as "." or specific strings) can be included in there with the goal of **bypassing restrictions**.

### Public URL template

```
https://{random_id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/{user_provided}
```
