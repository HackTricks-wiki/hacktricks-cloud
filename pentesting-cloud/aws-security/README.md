## Basic Information

**Before start pentesting** an **AWS** environment there are a few **basics things you need to know** about how AWS works to help you understand what you need to do, how to find misconfigurations and how to exploit them.

Concepts such as organization hierarchy, IAM and other basic concepts are explained in:

## AWS Pentester/Red Team Methodology

In order to audit an AWS environment it's very important to know: which **services are being used**, what is **being exposed**, who has **access** to what, and how are internal AWS services an **external services** connected.

From a Red Team point of view, the **first step to compromise an AWS environment** is to manage to obtain some **credentials**. Here you have some ideas on how to do that:

* **Leaks** in github (or similar) - OSINT
* **Social** Engineering
* **Password** reuse (password leaks)
* Vulnerabilities in AWS-Hosted Applications
  * [**Server Side Request Forgery**](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssrf-server-side-request-forgery/cloud-ssrf) with access to metadata endpoint
  * **Local File Read**
    * `/home/USERNAME/.aws/credentials`
    * `C:\Users\USERNAME\.aws\credentials`
* 3rd parties **breached**
* **Internal** Employee
* [**Cognito** ](aws-services/aws-cognito-enum/#cognito)credentials

Or by **compromising an unauthenticated service** exposed:

{% content-ref url="aws-unauthenticated-enum-access/" %}
[aws-unauthenticated-enum-access](aws-unauthenticated-enum-access/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Or if you are doing a **review** you could just **ask for credentials** with these roles:

{% content-ref url="aws-permissions-for-a-pentest.md" %}
[aws-permissions-for-a-pentest.md](aws-permissions-for-a-pentest.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
After you have managed to obtain credentials, you need to know **to who do those creds belong**, and **what they have access to**, so you need to perform some basic enumeration:
{% endhint %}

## Basic Enumeration

### SSRF

If you found a SSRF in a machine inside AWS check this page for tricks:

{% embed url="https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssrf-server-side-request-forgery/cloud-ssrf" %}

### Whoami

One of the first things you need to know is who you are (in where account you are in other info about the AWS env):

```bash
# Easiest way, but might be monitored?
aws sts get-caller-identity
aws iam get-user # This will get your own user

# If you have a Key ID
aws sts get-access-key-info --access-key-id=ASIA1234567890123456

# Get inside error message
aws sns publish --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:*account id*:aaa --message aaa

# From metadata
TOKEN=`curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600"`
curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
Note that companies might use **canary tokens** to identify when **tokens are being stolen and used**. It's recommended to check if a token is a canary token or not before using it.\
For more info [**check this page**](aws-services/aws-security-and-detection-services/aws-cloudtrail-enum.md#honeytokens-bypass).
{% endhint %}

### Org Enumeration

{% content-ref url="../aws-pentesting/aws-services/aws-organizations-enum.md" %}
[aws-organizations-enum.md](../aws-pentesting/aws-services/aws-organizations-enum.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### IAM Enumeration

If you have enough permissions **checking the privileges of each entity inside the AWS account** will help you understand what you and other identities can do and how to **escalate privileges**.

If you don't have enough permissions to enumerate IAM, you can **steal bruteforce them** to figure them out.\
Check **how to do the numeration and brute-forcing** in:

{% content-ref url="aws-services/aws-iam-enum.md" %}
[aws-iam-enum.md](aws-services/aws-iam-enum.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Now that you **have some information about your credentials** (and if you are a red team hopefully you **haven't been detected**). It's time to figure out which services are being used in the environment.\
In the following section you can check some ways to **enumerate some common services.**
{% endhint %}

## Services Enumeration, Post-Exploitation & Persistence

AWS has an astonishing amount of services, in the following page you will find **basic information, enumeration** cheatsheets\*\*,\*\* how to **avoid detection**, obtain **persistence**, and other **post-exploitation** tricks about some of them:

{% content-ref url="aws-services/" %}
[aws-services](aws-services/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Note that you **don't** need to perform all the work **manually**, below in this post you can find a **section about** [**automatic tools**](./#automated-tools).

Moreover, in this stage you might discovered **more services exposed to unauthenticated users,** you might be able to exploit them:

{% content-ref url="aws-unauthenticated-enum-access/" %}
[aws-unauthenticated-enum-access](aws-unauthenticated-enum-access/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Privilege Escalation

If you can **check at least your own permissions** over different resources you could **check if you are able to obtain further permissions**. You should focus at least in the permissions indicated in:

{% content-ref url="aws-privilege-escalation/" %}
[aws-privilege-escalation](aws-privilege-escalation/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Publicly Exposed Services

While enumerating AWS services you might have found some of them **exposing elements to the Internet** (VM/Containers ports, databases or queue services, snapshots or buckets...).\
As pentester/red teamer you should always check if you can find **sensitive information / vulnerabilities** on them as they might provide you **further access into the AWS account**.

In this book you should find **information** about how to find **exposed AWS services and how to check them**. About how to find **vulnerabilities in exposed network services** I would recommend you to **search** for the specific **service** in:

{% embed url="https://book.hacktricks.xyz/" %}

## Compromising the Organization

### From the root/management account

When the management account creates new accounts in the organization, a **new role** is created in the new account, by default named **`OrganizationAccountAccessRole`** and giving **AdministratorAccess** policy to the **management account** to access the new account.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (3) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

So, in order to access as administrator a child account you need:

* **Compromise** the **management** account and find the **ID** of the **children accounts** and the **names** of the **role** (OrganizationAccountAccessRole by default) allowing the management account to access as admin.
  * To find children accounts go to the organizations section in the aws console or run `aws organizations list-accounts`
  * You cannot find the name of the roles directly, so check all the custom IAM policies and search any allowing **`sts:AssumeRole` over the previously discovered children accounts**.
* **Compromise** a **principal** in the management account with **`sts:AssumeRole` permission over the role in the children accounts** (even if the account is allowing anyone from the management account to impersonate, as its an external account, specific `sts:AssumeRole` permissions are necessary).

## Automated Tools

It models the different IAM Users and Roles in an account as a directed graph, which enables checks for **privilege escalation** and for alternate paths an attacker could take to gain access to a resource or action in AWS. You can check the **permissions used to find privesc** paths in the filenames ended in `_edges.py` in [https://github.com/nccgroup/PMapper/tree/master/principalmapper/graphing](https://github.com/nccgroup/PMapper/tree/master/principalmapper/graphing)

  It will show you potentially **over privileged** customer, inline and aws **policies** and which **principals has access to them**. (It not only checks for privesc but also other kind of interesting permissions, recommended to use).

```bash
# Install
pip install cloudsplaining

# Download IAM policies to check
## Only the ones attached with the versions used
cloudsplaining download --profile dev

# Analyze the IAM policies
cloudsplaining scan --input-file /private/tmp/cloudsplaining/dev.json --output /tmp/files/

export HTTP_PROXY=http://localhost:8080
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://localhost:8080

# Capture with burp nor verifying ssl
aws --no-verify-ssl ...

# Dowload brup cert and transform it to pem
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/cert --output Downloads/certificate.cer
openssl x509 -inform der -in Downloads/certificate.cer -out Downloads/certificate.pem

# Indicate the ca cert to trust
export AWS_CA_BUNDLE=~/Downloads/certificate.pem

# Run aws cli normally trusting burp cert
aws ...
```
