# Kubernetes Kyverno bypass

## Abusing policies misconfiguration

### Enumerate rules

Having an overview may help to know which rules are active, on which mode and who can bypass it

```bash
$ kubectl get clusterpolicies
$ kubectl get policies
```

### Enumerate Excluded

For each ClusterPolicy and Policy, you can specify a list of excluded entities, including:

* Groups: `excludedGroups`
* Users: `excludedUsers`
* Service Accounts (SA): `excludedServiceAccounts`
* Roles: `excludedRoles`
* Cluster Roles: `excludedClusterRoles`

These excluded entities will be exempt from the policy requirements, and Kyverno will not enforce the policy for them.

## Example&#x20;

Let's dig into one clusterpolicy example :&#x20;

```
$ kubectl get clusterpolicies MYPOLICY -o yaml
```

Look for the excluded entities :&#x20;

```yaml
exclude:
      any:
      - clusterRoles:
        - cluster-admin
      - subjects:
        - kind: User
          name: system:serviceaccount:DUMMYNAMESPACE:admin
        - kind: User
          name: system:serviceaccount:TEST:thisisatest
        - kind: User
          name: system:serviceaccount:AHAH:*
          
```

Within a cluster, numerous added components, operators, and applications may necessitate exclusion from a cluster policy. However, this can be exploited by targeting privileged entities. In some cases, it may appear that a namespace does not exist or that you lack permission to impersonate a user, which can be a sign of misconfiguration.

## Abusing ValidatingWebhookConfiguration

Another way to bypass policies is to focus on the ValidatingWebhookConfiguration resource :&#x20;
