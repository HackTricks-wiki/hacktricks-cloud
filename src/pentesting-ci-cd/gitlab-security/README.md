## What is GitLab

GitLab is a complete DevSecOps platform that includes source code management (SCM), CI/CD, artifact management and more. Pipelines are described in a .gitlab-ci.yml file, and jobs are executed by GitLab Runner instances (self-managed or GitLab-hosted) using different executors (Docker, Shell, Kubernetes, etc.).

- Runners can be scoped at Instance, Group, or Project level and authenticate to GitLab using runner authentication tokens.
- Jobs receive CI/CD variables (including protected/masked ones) as environment variables in the job context.

## Abusing GitLab Runner

Attackers that can influence which runner binary/image is installed, or who can publish a lookalike runner image, may be able to silently exfiltrate all CI/CD variables from jobs executed by that runner.
