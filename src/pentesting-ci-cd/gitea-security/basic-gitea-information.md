# Basic Gitea Information

{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## Basic Structure

The basic Gitea environment structure is to group repos by **organization(s),** each of them may contain **several repositories** and **several teams.** However, note that just like in github users can have repos outside of the organization.

Moreover, a **user** can be a **member** of **different organizations**. Within the organization the user may have **different permissions over each repository**.

A user may also be **part of different teams** with different permissions over different repos.

And finally **repositories may have special protection mechanisms**.

## Permissions

### Organizations

When an **organization is created** a team called **Owners** is **created** and the user is put inside of it. This team will give **admin access** over the **organization**, those **permissions** and the **name** of the team **cannot be modified**.

**Org admins** (owners) can select the **visibility** of the organization:

- Public
- Limited (logged in users only)
- Private (members only)

**Org admins** can also indicate if the **repo admins** can **add and or remove access** for teams. They can also indicate the max number of repos.

When creating a new team, several important settings are selected:

- It's indicated the **repos of the org the members of the team will be able to access**: specific repos (repos where the team is added) or all.
- It's also indicated **if members can create new repos** (creator will get admin access to it)
- The **permissions** the **members** of the repo will **have**:
  - **Administrator** access
  - **Specific** access:

### Teams & Users

In a repo, the **org admin** and the **repo admins** (if allowed by the org) can **manage the roles** given to collaborators (other users) and teams. There are **3** possible **roles**:

- Administrator
- Write
- Read

## Gitea Authentication

### Web Access

Using **username + password** and potentially (and recommended) a 2FA.

### **SSH Keys**

You can configure your account with one or several public keys allowing the related **private key to perform actions on your behalf.** [http://localhost:3000/user/settings/keys](http://localhost:3000/user/settings/keys)

#### **GPG Keys**

You **cannot impersonate the user with these keys** but if you don't use it it might be possible that you **get discover for sending commits without a signature**.

### **Personal Access Tokens**

You can generate personal access token to **give an application access to your account**. A personal access token gives full access over your account: [http://localhost:3000/user/settings/applications](http://localhost:3000/user/settings/applications)

### Oauth Applications

Just like personal access tokens **Oauth applications** will have **complete access** over your account and the places your account has access because, as indicated in the [docs](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/oauth2-provider/#scopes), scopes aren't supported yet:

### Deploy keys

Deploy keys might have read-only or write access to the repo, so they might be interesting to compromise specific repos.

## Branch Protections

Branch protections are designed to **not give complete control of a repository** to the users. The goal is to **put several protection methods before being able to write code inside some branch**.

The **branch protections of a repository** can be found in _https://localhost:3000/<orgname>/<reponame>/settings/branches_

> [!NOTE]
> It's **not possible to set a branch protection at organization level**. So all of them must be declared on each repo.

Different protections can be applied to a branch (like to master):

- **Disable Push**: No-one can push to this branch
- **Enable Push**: Anyone with access can push, but not force push.
- **Whitelist Restricted Push**: Only selected users/teams can push to this branch (but no force push)
- **Enable Merge Whitelist**: Only whitelisted users/teams can merge PRs.
- **Enable Status checks:** Require status checks to pass before merging.
- **Require approvals**: Indicate the number of approvals required before a PR can be merged.
- **Restrict approvals to whitelisted**: Indicate users/teams that can approve PRs.
- **Block merge on rejected reviews**: If changes are requested, it cannot be merged (even if the other checks pass)
- **Block merge on official review requests**: If there official review requests it cannot be merged
- **Dismiss stale approvals**: When new commits, old approvals will be dismissed.
- **Require Signed Commits**: Commits must be signed.
- **Block merge if pull request is outdated**
- **Protected/Unprotected file patterns**: Indicate patterns of files to protect/unprotect against changes

> [!NOTE]
> As you can see, even if you managed to obtain some credentials of a user, **repos might be protected avoiding you to pushing code to master** for example to compromise the CI/CD pipeline.
