# Supabase Security

{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## Basic Information

As per their [**landing page**](https://supabase.com/): Supabase is an open source Firebase alternative. Start your project with a Postgres database, Authentication, instant APIs, Edge Functions, Realtime subscriptions, Storage, and Vector embeddings.

### Subdomain

Basically when a project is created, the user will receive a supabase.co subdomain like: **`jnanozjdybtpqgcwhdiz.supabase.co`**

## **Database configuration**

> [!TIP]
> **This data can be accessed from a link like `https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/<project-id>/settings/database`**

This **database** will be deployed in some AWS region, and in order to connect to it it would be possible to do so connecting to: `postgres://postgres.jnanozjdybtpqgcwhdiz:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres` (this was crated in us-west-1).\
The password is a **password the user put** previously.

Therefore, as the subdomain is a known one and it's used as username and the AWS regions are limited, it might be possible to try to **brute force the password**.

This section also contains options to:

- Reset the database password
- Configure connection pooling
- Configure SSL: Reject plan-text connections (by default they are enabled)
- Configure Disk size
- Apply network restrictions and bans

## API Configuration

> [!TIP]
> **This data can be accessed from a link like `https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/<project-id>/settings/api`**

The URL to access the supabase API in your project is going to be like: `https://jnanozjdybtpqgcwhdiz.supabase.co`.

### anon api keys

It'll also generate an **anon API key** (`role: "anon"`), like: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImpuYW5vemRyb2J0cHFnY3doZGl6Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3MTQ5OTI3MTksImV4cCI6MjAzMDU2ODcxOX0.sRN0iMGM5J741pXav7UxeChyqBE9_Z-T0tLA9Zehvqk` that the application will need to use in order to contact the API key exposed in our example in

It's possible to find the API REST to contact this API in the [**docs**](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/self-hosting-auth/returns-the-configuration-settings-for-the-gotrue-server), but the most interesting endpoints would be:

</details>

So, whenever you discover a client using supabase with the subdomain they were granted (it's possible that a subdomain of the company has a CNAME over their supabase subdomain), you might try to **create a new account in the platform using the supabase API**.

### secret / service_role api keys

A secret API key will also be generated with **`role: "service_role"`**. This API key should be secret because it will be able to bypass **Row Level Security**.

The API key looks like this: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImpuYW5vemRyb2J0cHFnY3doZGl6Iiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImlhdCI6MTcxNDk5MjcxOSwiZXhwIjoyMDMwNTY4NzE5fQ.0a8fHGp3N_GiPq0y0dwfs06ywd-zhTwsm486Tha7354`

### JWT Secret

A **JWT Secret** will also be generate so the application can **create and sign custom JWT tokens**.

## Authentication

### Signups

> [!TIP]
> By **default** supabase will allow **new users to create accounts** on your project by using the previously mentioned API endpoints.

However, these new accounts, by default, **will need to validate their email address** to be able to login into the account. It's possible to enable **"Allow anonymous sign-ins"** to allow people to login without verifying their email address. This could grant access to **unexpected data** (they get the roles `public` and `authenticated`).\
This is a very bad idea because supabase charges per active user so people could create users and login and supabase will charge for those:

<figure><img src="../images/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Passwords & sessions

It's possible to indicate the minimum password length (by default), requirements (no by default) and disallow to use leaked passwords.\
It's recommended to **improve the requirements as the default ones are weak**.

- User Sessions: It's possible to configure how user sessions work (timeouts, 1 session per user...)
- Bot and Abuse Protection: It's possible to enable Captcha.

### SMTP Settings

It's possible to set an SMTP to send emails.

### Advanced Settings

- Set expire time to access tokens (3600 by default)
- Set to detect and revoke potentially compromised refresh tokens and timeout
- MFA: Indicate how many MFA factors can be enrolled at once per user (10 by default)
- Max Direct Database Connections: Max number of connections used to auth (10 by default)
- Max Request Duration: Maximum time allowed for an Auth request to last (10s by default)

## Storage

> [!TIP]
> Supabase allows **to store files** and make them accesible over a URL (it uses S3 buckets).

- Set the upload file size limit (default is 50MB)
- The S3 connection is given with a URL like: `https://jnanozjdybtpqgcwhdiz.supabase.co/storage/v1/s3`
- It's possible to **request S3 access key** that are formed by an `access key ID` (e.g. `a37d96544d82ba90057e0e06131d0a7b`) and a `secret access key` (e.g. `58420818223133077c2cec6712a4f909aec93b4daeedae205aa8e30d5a860628`)

## Edge Functions

It's possible to **store secrets** in supabase also which will be **accessible by edge functions** (the can be created and deleted from the web, but it's not possible to access their value directly).
