# Cloudflare Domains

{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

In each TLD configured in Cloudflare there are some **general settings and services** that can be configured. In this page we are going to **analyze the security related settings of each section:**

<figure><img src="../../images/image (101).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

- [ ] Get a feeling of **how much** are the services of the account **used**
- [ ] Find also the **zone ID** and the **account ID**

### Analytics

- [ ] In **`Security`** check if there is any **Rate limiting**

### DNS

- [ ] Check **interesting** (sensitive?) data in DNS **records**
- [ ] Check for **subdomains** that could contain **sensitive info** just based on the **name** (like admin173865324.domin.com)
- [ ] Check for web pages that **aren't** **proxied**
- [ ] Check for **proxified web pages** that can be **accessed directly** by CNAME or IP address
- [ ] Check that **DNSSEC** is **enabled**
- [ ] Check that **CNAME Flattening** is **used** in **all CNAMEs**
- This is could be useful to **hide subdomain takeover vulnerabilities** and improve load timings
- [ ] Check that the domains [**aren't vulnerable to spoofing**](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-smtp#mail-spoofing)

### SSL/TLS

#### **Overview**

- [ ] The **SSL/TLS encryption** should be **Full** or **Full (Strict)**. Any other will send **clear-text traffic** at some point.
- [ ] The **SSL/TLS Recommender** should be enabled

#### Edge Certificates

- [ ] **Always Use HTTPS** should be **enabled**
- [ ] **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)** should be **enabled**
- [ ] **Minimum TLS Version should be 1.2**
- [ ] **TLS 1.3 should be enabled**
- [ ] **Automatic HTTPS Rewrites** should be **enabled**
- [ ] **Certificate Transparency Monitoring** should be **enabled**

### **Security**

- [ ] In the **`WAF`** section it's interesting to check that **Firewall** and **rate limiting rules are used** to prevent abuses.
- The **`Bypass`** action will **disable Cloudflare security** features for a request. It shouldn't be used.
- [ ] In the **`Page Shield`** section it's recommended to check that it's **enabled** if any page is used
- [ ] In the **`API Shield`** section it's recommended to check that it's **enabled** if any API is exposed in Cloudflare
- [ ] In the **`DDoS`** section it's recommended to enable the **DDoS protections**
- [ ] In the **`Settings`** section:
- [ ] Check that the **`Security Level`** is **medium** or greater
- [ ] Check that the **`Challenge Passage`** is 1 hour at max
- [ ] Check that the **`Browser Integrity Check`** is **enabled**
- [ ] Check that the **`Privacy Pass Support`** is **enabled**

#### **CloudFlare DDoS Protection**

- If you can, enable **Bot Fight Mode** or **Super Bot Fight Mode**. If you protecting some API accessed programmatically (from a JS front end page for example). You might not be able to enable this without breaking that access.
- In **WAF**: You can create **rate limits by URL path** or to **verified bots** (Rate limiting rules), or to **block access** based on IP, Cookie, referrer...). So you could block requests that doesn't come from a web page or has a cookie.
- If the attack is from a **verified bot**, at least **add a rate limit** to bots.
- If the attack is to a **specific path**, as prevention mechanism, add a **rate limit** in this path.
- You can also **whitelist** IP addresses, IP ranges, countries or ASNs from the **Tools** in WAF.
- Check if **Managed rules** could also help to prevent vulnerability exploitations.
- In the **Tools** section you can **block or give a challenge to specific IPs** and **user agents.**
- In DDoS you could **override some rules to make them more restrictive**.
- **Settings**: Set **Security Level** to **High** and to **Under Attack** if you are Under Attack and that the **Browser Integrity Check is enabled**.
- In Cloudflare Domains -> Analytics -> Security -> Check if **rate limit** is enabled
- In Cloudflare Domains -> Security -> Events -> Check for **detected malicious Events**

### Speed

_I couldn't find any option related to security_

### Caching

- [ ] In the **`Configuration`** section consider enabling the **CSAM Scanning Tool**

### **Workers Routes**

_You should have already checked_ [_cloudflare workers_](./#workers)

### Rules

TODO

### Network

- [ ] If **`HTTP/2`** is **enabled**, **`HTTP/2 to Origin`** should be **enabled**
- [ ] **`HTTP/3 (with QUIC)`** should be **enabled**
- [ ] If the **privacy** of your **users** is important, make sure **`Onion Routing`** is **enabled**

### **Traffic**

TODO

### Custom Pages

- [ ] It's optional to configure custom pages when an error related to security is triggered (like a block, rate limiting or I'm under attack mode)

### Apps

TODO

### Scrape Shield

- [ ] Check **Email Address Obfuscation** is **enabled**
- [ ] Check **Server-side Excludes** is **enabled**
