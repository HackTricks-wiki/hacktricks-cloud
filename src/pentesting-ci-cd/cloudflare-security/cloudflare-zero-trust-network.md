In a **Cloudflare Zero Trust Network** account there are some **settings and services** that can be configured. In this page we are going to **analyze the security related settings of each section:**

### Analytics

- [ ] Useful to **get to know the environment**

### **Gateway**

- [ ] In **`Policies`** it's possible to generate policies to **restrict** by **DNS**, **network** or **HTTP** request who can access applications.
  - If used, **policies** could be created to **restrict** the access to malicious sites.
  - This is **only relevant if a gateway is being used**, if not, there is no reason to create defensive policies.

### Access

#### Applications

On each application:

- [ ] Check **who** can access to the application in the **Policies** and check that **only** the **users** that **need access** to the application can access.
  - To allow access **`Access Groups`** are going to be used (and **additional rules** can be set also)
- [ ] Check the **available identity providers** and make sure they **aren't too open**
- [ ] In **`Settings`**:
  - [ ] Check **CORS isn't enabled** (if it's enabled, check it's **secure** and it isn't allowing everything)
  - [ ] Cookies should have **Strict Same-Site** attribute, **HTTP Only** and **binding cookie** should be **enabled** if the application is HTTP.
  - [ ] Consider enabling also **Browser rendering** for better **protection. More info about** [**remote browser isolation here**](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-and-remote-browser-isolation/)**.**

#### **Access Groups**

- [ ] Check that the access groups generated are **correctly restricted** to the users they should allow.
- [ ] It's specially important to check that the **default access group isn't very open** (it's **not allowing too many people**) as by **default** anyone in that **group** is going to be able to **access applications**.
  - Note that it's possible to give **access** to **EVERYONE** and other **very open policies** that aren't recommended unless 100% necessary.

#### Service Auth

- [ ] Check that all service tokens **expires in 1 year or less**

#### Tunnels

TODO

### My Team

TODO

### Settings
