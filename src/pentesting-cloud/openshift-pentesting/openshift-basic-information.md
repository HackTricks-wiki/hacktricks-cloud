Before working with OpenShift, ensure you are comfortable with the Kubernetes environment. The entire OpenShift chapter assumes you have prior knowledge of Kubernetes.

## OpenShift - Basic Information

### Introduction

OpenShift is Red Hatâ€™s container application platform that offers a superset of Kubernetes features. OpenShift has stricter security policies. For instance, it is forbidden to run a container as root. It also offers a secure-by-default option to enhance security. OpenShift, features an web console which includes a one-touch login page.

#### CLI

OpenShift come with a it's own CLI, that can be found here:

To login using the CLI:

```bash
oc login -u=<username> -p=<password> -s=<server>
oc login -s=<server> --token=<bearer token>
```

### **OpenShift - Security Context Constraints** <a href="#a94e" id="a94e"></a>

In addition to the [RBAC resources](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#architecture-additional-concepts-authorization) that control what a user can do, OpenShift Container Platform provides _security context constraints_ (SCC) that control the actions that a pod can perform and what it has the ability to access.

SCC is a policy object that has special rules that correspond with the infrastructure itself, unlike RBAC that has rules that correspond with the Platform. It helps us define what Linux access-control features the container should be able to request/run. Example: Linux Capabilities, SECCOMP profiles, Mount localhost dirs, etc.
