# OpenShift - Tekton

### What is tekton

According to the doc: _Tekton is a powerful and flexible open-source framework for creating CI/CD systems, allowing developers to build, test, and deploy across cloud providers and on-premise systems._ Both Jenkins and Tekton can be used to test, build and deploy applications, however Tekton is Cloud Native.&#x20;

With Tekton everything is represented by YAML files. Developers can create Custom Resources (CR) of type `Pipelines` and specify multiple `Tasks` in them that they want to run. To run a Pipeline resources of type `PipelineRun` must be created.

When tekton is installed a service account (sa) called pipeline is created in every namespace. When a Pipeline is ran, a pod will be spawned using this sa called `pipeline` to run the tasks defined in the YAML file.

### The Pipeline service account capabilities

By default, the pipeline service account can use the `pipelines-scc` capability. This is due to the global default configuration of tekton. Actually, the global config of tekton is also a YAML in an openshift object called `TektonConfig` that can be seen if you have some reader roles in the cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: TektonConfig
metadata:
  name: config
spec:
  ...
  ...
  platforms:
    openshift:
      scc:
        default: "pipelines-scc"
```

In any namespace, if you can get the pipeline service account token you will be able to use `pipelines-scc`.

### The Misconfig

The problem is that the default scc that the pipeline sa can use is user controllable. This can be done using a label in the namespace definition. For instance, if I can create a namespace with the following yaml definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: test-namespace
  annotations:
    operator.tekton.dev/scc: privileged
```

The tekton operator will give to the pipeline service account in `test-namespace` the ability to use the scc privileged. This will allow the mounting of the node.

### The fix

Tekton documents about how to restrict the override of scc by adding a label in the `TektonConfig` object.

This label is called `max-allowed`&#x20;

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: TektonConfig
metadata:
  name: config
spec:
  ...
  ...
  platforms:
    openshift:
      scc:
        default: "restricted-v2"
        maxAllowed: "privileged"
```
