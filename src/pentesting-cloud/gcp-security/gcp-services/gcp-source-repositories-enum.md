# GCP - Source Repositories Enum

{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## Basic Information <a href="#reviewing-cloud-git-repositories" id="reviewing-cloud-git-repositories"></a>

Google Cloud Source Repositories is a fully-featured, scalable, **private Git repository service**. It's designed to **host your source code in a fully managed environment**, integrating seamlessly with other GCP tools and services. It offers a collaborative and secure place for teams to store, manage, and track their code.

Key features of Cloud Source Repositories include:

1. **Fully Managed Git Hosting**: Offers the familiar functionality of Git, meaning you can use regular Git commands and workflows.
2. **Integration with GCP Services**: Integrates with other GCP services like Cloud Build, Pub/Sub, and App Engine for end-to-end traceability from code to deployment.
3. **Private Repositories**: Ensures your code is stored securely and privately. You can control access using Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles.
4. **Source Code Analysis**: Works with other GCP tools to provide automated analysis of your source code, identifying potential issues like bugs, vulnerabilities, or bad coding practices.
5. **Collaboration Tools**: Supports collaborative coding with tools like merge requests, comments, and reviews.
6. **Mirror Support**: Allows you to connect Cloud Source Repositories with repositories hosted on GitHub or Bitbucket, enabling automatic synchronization and providing a unified view of all your repositories.

### OffSec information <a href="#reviewing-cloud-git-repositories" id="reviewing-cloud-git-repositories"></a>

- The source repositories configuration inside a project will have a **Service Account** used to publishing Cloud Pub/Sub messages. The default one used is the **Compute SA**. However, **I don't think it's possible steal its token** from Source Repositories as it's being executed in the background.
- To see the code inside the GCP Cloud Source Repositories web console ([https://source.cloud.google.com/](https://source.cloud.google.com/)), you need the code to be **inside master branch by default**.
- You can also **create a mirror Cloud Repository** pointing to a repo from **Github** or **Bitbucket** (giving access to those platforms).
- It's possible to **code & debug from inside GCP**.
- By default, Source Repositories **prevents private keys to be pushed in commits**, but this can be disabled.

### Open In Cloud Shell

It's possible to open the repository in Cloud Shell, a prompt like this one will appear:

This will allow you to code and debug in Cloud Shell (which could get cloudshell compromised).

### Enumeration

```bash
# Repos enumeration
gcloud source repos list #Get names and URLs
gcloud source repos describe <repo_name>
gcloud source repos get-iam-policy <repo_name>

# gcloud repo clone
gcloud source repos clone <REPO NAME>
gcloud source repos get-iam-policy <REPO NAME>
... git add & git commit -m ...
git push --set-upstream origin master
git push -u origin master

# Access via git
## To add a SSH key go to https://source.cloud.google.com/user/ssh_keys (no gcloud command)
git clone ssh://username@domain.com@source.developers.google.com:2022/p/<proj-name>/r/<repo-name>
git add, commit, push...
```
