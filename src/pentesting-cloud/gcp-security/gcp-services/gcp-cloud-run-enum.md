## Cloud Run <a href="#reviewing-cloud-run-configurations" id="reviewing-cloud-run-configurations"></a>

Cloud Run is a serverless managed compute platform that lets you **run containers** directly on top of Google's scalable infrastructure.

You can run your container or If you're using Go, Node.js, Python, Java, .NET Core, or Ruby, you can use the [source-based deployment](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/deploying-source-code) option that **builds the container for you.**

Google has built Cloud Run to **work well together with other services on Google Cloud**, so you can build full-featured applications.

### Services and jobs <a href="#services-and-jobs" id="services-and-jobs"></a>

On Cloud Run, your code can either run continuously as a _**service**_ or as a _**job**_. Both services and jobs run in the same environment and can use the same integrations with other services on Google Cloud.

- **Cloud Run services.** Used to run code that responds to web requests, or events.
- **Cloud Run jobs.** Used to run code that performs work (a job) and quits when the work is done.

## Cloud Run Service

Google [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) is another serverless offer where you can search for env variables also. Cloud Run creates a small web server, running on port 8080 inside the container by default, that sits around waiting for an HTTP GET request. When the request is received, a job is executed and the job log is output via an HTTP response.

### Relevant details

- By **default**, the **access** to the web server is **public**, but it can also be **limited to internal traffic** (VPC...)\
  Moreover, the **authentication** to contact the web server can be **allowing all** or to **require authentication via IAM**.
- By default, the **encryption** uses a **Google managed key**, but a **CMEK** (Customer Managed Encryption Key) from **KMS** can also be **chosen**.
- By **default**, the **service account** used is the **Compute Engine default one** which has **Editor** access over the project and it has the **scope `cloud-platform`.**
- It's possible to define **clear-text environment variables** for the execution, and even **mount cloud secrets** or **add cloud secrets to environment variables.**
- It's also possible to **add connections with Cloud SQL** and **mount a file system.**
- The **URLs** of the services deployed are similar to **`https://<svc-name>-<random>.a.run.app`**
- A Run Service can have **more than 1 version or revision**, and **split traffic** among several revisions.

### Enumeration

```bash
# List services
gcloud run services list
gcloud run services list --platform=managed
gcloud run services list --platform=gke

# Get info of a service
gcloud run services describe --region <region> <svc-name>

# Get info of all the services together
gcloud run services list --format=yaml
gcloud run services list --platform=managed --format=json
gcloud run services list --platform=gke --format=json

# Get policy
gcloud run services get-iam-policy --region <region> <svc-name>

# Get revisions
gcloud run revisions list --region <region>
gcloud run revisions describe --region <region> <revision>

# Get domains
gcloud run domain-mappings list
gcloud run domain-mappings describe <name>

# Attempt to trigger a job unauthenticated
curl <url>

# Attempt to trigger a job with your current gcloud authorization
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token)" <url>
```

## Cloud Run Jobs

Cloud Run jobs are be a better fit for **containers that run to completion and don't serve requests**. Jobs don't have the ability to serve requests or listen on a port. This means that unlike Cloud Run services, jobs should not bundle a web server. Instead, jobs containers should exit when they are done.

### Enumeration

```bash
gcloud beta run jobs list
gcloud beta run jobs describe --region <region> <job-name>
gcloud beta run jobs get-iam-policy --region <region> <job-name>
```
