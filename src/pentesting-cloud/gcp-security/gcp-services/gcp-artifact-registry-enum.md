# GCP - Artifact Registry Enum

{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## Basic Information

Google Cloud Artifact Registry is a fully managed service that allows you to **manage, store, and secure your software artifacts**. It's essentially a repository for **storing build dependencies**, such as **Docker** images, **Maven**, npm packages, and other types of artifacts. It's **commonly used in CI/CD pipelines** for storing and versioning the artifacts produced during the software development process.

Key features of Artifact Registry include:

1. **Unified Repository**: It supports **multiple types of artifacts**, allowing you to have a single repository for Docker images, language packages (like Java’s Maven, Node.js’s npm), and other types of artifacts, enabling consistent access controls and a unified view across all your artifacts.
2. **Fully Managed**: As a managed service, it takes care of the underlying infrastructure, scaling, and security, reducing the maintenance overhead for users.
3. **Fine-grained Access Control**: It integrates with Google Cloud’s Identity and Access Management (IAM), allowing you to define who can access, upload, or download artifacts in your repositories.
4. **Geo-replication**: It supports the replication of artifacts across multiple regions, improving the speed of downloads and ensuring availability.
5. **Integration with Google Cloud Services**: It works seamlessly with **other GCP services like Cloud Build, Kubernetes Engine, and Compute Engine**, making it a convenient choice for teams already working within the Google Cloud ecosystem.
6. **Security**: Offers features like **vulnerability scanning and container analysis** to help ensure that the stored artifacts are secure and free from known security issues.

### Formats and Modes

When creating a new repository it's possible to **select a the format/type** of the repository among several like Docker, Maven, npm, Python... and the mode which usually can be one of these three:

- **Standard Repository**: Default mode for **storing your own artifacts** (like Docker images, Maven packages) directly in GCP. It's secure, scalable, and integrates well within the Google Cloud ecosystem.
- **Remote Repository** (if available): Acts as a proxy for **caching artifacts from external**, public repositories. It helps prevent issues from dependencies changing upstream and reduces latency by caching frequently accessed artifacts.
- **Virtual Repository** (if available): Provides a **unified interface to access multiple (standard or remote) repositories** through a single endpoint, simplifying client-side configuration and access management for artifacts spread across various repositories.
  - For a virtual repository you will need to **select repositories and give them a priority** (the repo with the largest priority will be used).
  - You can **mix remote and standard** repositories in a **virtual** one, if the **priority** of the **remote** is **bigger** than the standard, **packages from remote (PyPi for example) will be used**. This could lead to a **Dependency Confusion.**

Note that in the **Remote version of Docker** it's possible to give a username and token to access Docker Hub. The **token is then stored in the Secret Manager**.

### Encryption

As expected, by default a Google-managed key is used but a Customer-managed key can be indicated (CMEK).

### Cleanup Policies

- **Delete artifacts:** Artifacts will be **deleted according to cleanup policy** criteria.
- **Dry run:** (Default one) Artifacts will **not be deleted**. Cleanup policies will be evaluated, and test delete events sent to Cloud Audit Logging.

### Vulnerability Scanning

It's possible to enable the **vulnerability scanner** which will check for vulnerabilities inside **container images**.

### Enumeration

```bash
# Get repositories
gcloud artifacts repositories list
gcloud artifacts repositories describe --location <location> <repo-name>
gcloud artifacts versions list --repository=<repo-name> -location <location> --package <package-name>

# Get settings of a repository (example using python but could be other)
gcloud artifacts print-settings python --repository <repo-name> --location <location>

# Get docker images
gcloud artifacts docker images list us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/<proj-name>/<repo-name>

# Get packages (like python and others...)
gcloud artifacts packages list --repository <repo-name> --location <location>

# Get SBOMB artifacts
gcloud artifacts sbom list

# Get vulnerabilities (docker images)
gcloud artifacts vulnerabilities list us-east1-docker.pkg.dev/project123/repository123/someimage@sha256:49765698074d6d7baa82f
gcloud artifacts docker images list-vulnerabilities projects/<proj-name>/locations/<location>/scans/<scan-uuid>
