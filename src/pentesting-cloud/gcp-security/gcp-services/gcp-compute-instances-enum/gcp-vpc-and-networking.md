# GCP - VPC & Networking

{{#include ../../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## **GCP Compute Networking in a Nutshell**

**VPCs** contains **Firewall** rules to allow incoming traffic to the VPC. VPCs also contains **subnetworks** where **virtual machines** are going to be **connected**.\
Comparing with AWS, **Firewall** would be the **closest** thing to **AWS** **Security Groups and NACLs**, but in this case these are **defined in the VPC** and not in each instance.

## **VPC, Subnetworks & Firewalls in GCP**

Compute Instances are connected **subnetworks** which are part of **VPCs** ([Virtual Private Clouds](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc)). In GCP there aren't security groups, there are [**VPC firewalls**](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewalls) with rules defined at this network level but applied to each VM Instance.

### Subnetworks

A **VPC** can have **several subnetworks**. Each **subnetwork is in 1 region**.

### Firewalls

By default, every network has two [**implied firewall rules**](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewalls#default_firewall_rules): **allow outbound** and **deny inbound**.

When a GCP project is created, a VPC called **`default`** is also created, with the following firewall rules:

- **default-allow-internal:** allow all traffic from other instances on the `default` network
- **default-allow-ssh:** allow 22 from everywhere
- **default-allow-rdp:** allow 3389 from everywhere
- **default-allow-icmp:** allow ping from everywhere

> [!WARNING]
> As you can see, **firewall rules** tend to be **more permissive** for **internal IP addresses**. The default VPC permits all traffic between Compute Instances.

More **Firewall rules** can be created for the default VPC or for new VPCs. [**Firewall rules**](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewalls) can be applied to instances via the following **methods**:

- [**Network tags**](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/add-remove-network-tags)
- [**Service accounts**](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewalls#serviceaccounts)
- **All instances within a VPC**

Unfortunately, there isn't a simple `gcloud` command to spit out all Compute Instances with open ports on the internet. You have to connect the dots between firewall rules, network tags, services accounts, and instances.

This process was automated using [this python script](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/gl-redteam/gcp_firewall_enum) which will export the following:

- CSV file showing instance, public IP, allowed TCP, allowed UDP
- nmap scan to target all instances on ports ingress allowed from the public internet (0.0.0.0/0)
- masscan to target the full TCP range of those instances that allow ALL TCP ports from the public internet (0.0.0.0/0)

### Hierarchical Firewall Policies <a href="#hierarchical-firewall-policies" id="hierarchical-firewall-policies"></a>

_Hierarchical firewall policies_ let you create and **enforce a consistent firewall policy across your organization**. You can assign **hierarchical firewall policies to the organization** as a whole or to individual **folders**. These policies contain rules that can explicitly deny or allow connections.

You create and apply firewall policies as separate steps. You can create and apply firewall policies at the **organization or folder nodes of the** [**resource hierarchy**](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy). A firewall policy rule can **block connections, allow connections, or defer firewall rule evaluation** to lower-level folders or VPC firewall rules defined in VPC networks.

By default, all hierarchical firewall policy rules apply to all VMs in all projects under the organization or folder where the policy is associated. However, you can **restrict which VMs get a given rule** by specifying [target networks or target service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewall-policies#targets).

You can read here how to [**create a Hierarchical Firewall Policy**](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-firewall-policies#gcloud).

### Firewall Rules Evaluation

1. Org: Firewall policies assigned to the Organization
2. Folder: Firewall policies assigned to the Folder
3. VPC: Firewall rules assigned to the VPC
4. Global: Another type of firewall rules that can be assigned to VPCs
5. Regional: Firewall rules associated with the VPC network of the VM's NIC and region of the VM.

## VPC Network Peering

Allows to connect two Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks so that **resources in each network can communicate** with each other.\
Peered VPC networks can be in the same project, different projects of the same organization, or **different projects of different organizations**.

These are the needed permissions:

- `compute.networks.addPeering`
- `compute.networks.updatePeering`
- `compute.networks.removePeering`
- `compute.networks.listPeeringRoutes`

[**More in the docs**](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc-peering).
