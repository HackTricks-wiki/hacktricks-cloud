### Add yourself to a group

If your user has enough permissions or the group is misconfigured, he might be able to make himself a member of a new group:

```bash
gcloud identity groups memberships add --group-email <email> --member-email <email> [--roles OWNER]
# If --roles isn't specified you will get MEMBER
```

### Modify group membership

If your user has enough permissions or the group is misconfigured, he might be able to make himself OWNER of a group he is a member of:

```bash
# Check the current membership level
gcloud identity groups memberships describe --member-email <email> --group-email <email>

# If not OWNER try
gcloud identity groups memberships modify-membership-roles --group-email <email> --member-email <email> --add-roles=OWNER
```
