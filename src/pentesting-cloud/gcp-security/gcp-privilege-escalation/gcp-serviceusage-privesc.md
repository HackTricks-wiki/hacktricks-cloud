# GCP - Serviceusage Privesc

## serviceusage

The following permissions are useful to create and steal API keys, not this from the docs: _An API key is a simple encrypted string that **identifies an application without any principal**. They are useful for accessing **public data anonymously**, and are used to **associate** API requests with your project for quota and **billing**._

Therefore, with an API key you can make that company pay for your use of the API, but you won't be able to escalate privileges.

To learn other permissions and ways to generate API keys check:

### `serviceusage.apiKeys.create`

An undocumented API was found that can be used to **create API keys:**

```bash
curl -XPOST "https://apikeys.clients6.google.com/v1/projects/<project-uniq-name>/apiKeys?access_token=$(gcloud auth print-access-token)"
```

### `serviceusage.apiKeys.list`

Another undocumented API was found for listing API keys that have already been created (the API keys appears in the response):

```bash
curl "https://apikeys.clients6.google.com/v1/projects/<project-uniq-name>/apiKeys?access_token=$(gcloud auth print-access-token)"
```

### **`serviceusage.services.enable`** , **`serviceusage.services.use`**

With these permissions an attacker can enable and use new services in the project. This could allow an **attacker to enable service like admin or cloudidentity** to try to access Workspace information, or other services to access interesting data.
