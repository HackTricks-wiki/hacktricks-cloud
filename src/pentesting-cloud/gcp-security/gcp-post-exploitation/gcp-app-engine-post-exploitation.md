### `appengine.memcache.addKey` | `appengine.memcache.list` | `appengine.memcache.getKey` | `appengine.memcache.flush`

With these permissions it's possible to:

- Add a key
- List keys
- Get a key
- Delete

> [!CAUTION]
> However, I **couldn't find any way to access this information from the cli**, only from the **web console** where you need to know the **Key type** and the **Key name**, of from the a**pp engine running app**.
>
> If you know easier ways to use these permissions send a Pull Request!

### `logging.views.access`

With this permission it's possible to **see the logs of the App**:

```bash
gcloud app logs tail -s <name>
```

### Read Source Code

The source code of all the versions and services are **stored in the bucket** with the name **`staging.<proj-id>.appspot.com`**. If you have write access over it you can read the source code and search for **vulnerabilities** and **sensitive information**.

### Modify Source Code

Modify source code to steal credentials if they are being sent or perform a defacement web attack.
