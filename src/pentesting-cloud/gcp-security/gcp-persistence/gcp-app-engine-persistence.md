### Modify code

If yoi could just modify the code of a running version or create a new one yo could make it run your backdoor and mantain persistence.

### Old version persistence

**Every version of the web application is going to be run**, if you find that an App Engine project is running several versions, you could **create a new one** with your **backdoor** code, and then **create a new legit** one so the last one is the legit but there will be a **backdoored one also running**.
