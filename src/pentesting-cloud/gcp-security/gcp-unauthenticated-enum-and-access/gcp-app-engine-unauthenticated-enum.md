### Brute Force Subdomains

As mentioned the URL assigned to App Engine web pages is **`<project-uniq-name>.appspot.com`** and if a service name is used it'll be: **`<servicename>-dot-<project-uniq-name>.appspot.com`**.

As the **`project-uniq-name`** can be set by the person creating the project, they might be not that random and **brute-forcing them could find App Engine web apps exposed by companies**.

You could use tools like the ones indicated in:

./
