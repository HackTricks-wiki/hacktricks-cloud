### Security Group Connection Tracking Persistence

If a defender finds that an **EC2 instance was compromised** he will probably try to **isolate** the **network** of the machine. He could do this with an explicit **Deny NACL** (but NACLs affect the entire subnet), or **changing the security group** not allowing **any kind of inbound or outbound** traffic.

If the attacker had a **reverse shell originated from the machine**, even if the SG is modified to not allow inboud or outbound traffic, the **connection won't be killed due to** [**Security Group Connection Tracking**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html)**.**

### EC2 Lifecycle Manager

This service allow to **schedule** the **creation of AMIs and snapshots** and even **share them with other accounts**.\
An attacker could configure the **generation of AMIs or snapshots** of all the images or all the volumes **every week** and **share them with his account**.

### Scheduled Instances

It's possible to schedule instances to run daily, weekly or even monthly. An attacker could run a machine with high privileges or interesting access where he could access.

### Spot Fleet Request

Spot instances are **cheaper** than regular instances. An attacker could launch a **small spot fleet request for 5 year** (for example), with **automatic IP** assignment and a **user data** that sends to the attacker **when the spot instance start** and the **IP address** and with a **high privileged IAM role**.

### Backdoor Instances

An attacker could get access to the instances and backdoor them:

- Using a traditional **rootkit** for example
- Adding a new **public SSH key** (check [EC2 privesc options](../aws-privilege-escalation/aws-ec2-privesc.md))
- Backdooring the **User Data**

### **Backdoor Launch Configuration**

- Backdoor the used AMI
- Backdoor the User Data
- Backdoor the Key Pair

### VPN

Create a VPN so the attacker will be able to connect directly through i to the VPC.

### VPC Peering

Create a peering connection between the victim VPC and the attacker VPC so he will be able to access the victim VPC.
