### User persistence

Cognito is a service that allows to give roles to unauthenticated and authenticated users and to control a directory of users. Several different configurations can be altered to maintain some persistence, like:

- **Adding a User Pool** controlled by the user to an Identity Pool
- Give an **IAM role to an unauthenticated Identity Pool and allow Basic auth flow**
  - Or to an **authenticated Identity Pool** if the attacker can login
  - Or **improve the permissions** of the given roles
- **Create, verify & privesc** via attributes controlled users or new users in a **User Pool**
- **Allowing external Identity Providers** to login in a User Pool or in an Identity Pool

Check how to do these actions in

### `cognito-idp:SetRiskConfiguration`

An attacker with this privilege could modify the risk configuration to be able to login as a Cognito user **without having alarms being triggered**. [**Check out the cli**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cognito-idp/set-risk-configuration.html) to check all the options:

```bash
aws cognito-idp set-risk-configuration --user-pool-id <pool-id> --compromised-credentials-risk-configuration EventFilter=SIGN_UP,Actions={EventAction=NO_ACTION}
```

By default this is disabled:
