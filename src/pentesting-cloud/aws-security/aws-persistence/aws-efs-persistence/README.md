### Modify Resource Policy / Security Groups

Modifying the **resource policy and/or security groups** you can try to persist your access into the file system.

### Create Access Point

You could **create an access point** (with root access to `/`) accessible from a service were you have implemented **other persistence** to keep privileged access to the file system.
