### Common IAM Persistence

- Create a user
- Add a controlled user to a privileged group
- Create access keys (of the new user or of all users)
- Grant extra permissions to controlled users/groups (attached policies or inline policies)
- Disable MFA / Add you own MFA device
- Create a Role Chain Juggling situation (more on this below in STS persistence)

### Backdoor Role Trust Policies

You could backdoor a trust policy to be able to assume it for an external resource controlled by you (or to everyone):

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": ["*", "arn:aws:iam::123213123123:root"]
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Backdoor Policy Version

Give Administrator permissions to a policy in not its last version (the last version should looks legit), then assign that version of the policy to a controlled user/group.

### Backdoor / Create Identity Provider

If the account is already trusting a common identity provider (such as Github) the conditions of the trust could be increased so the attacker can abuse them.
