### Using resource policy

In SQS you need to indicate with an IAM policy **who has access to read and write**. It's possible to indicate external accounts, ARN of roles, or **even "\*"**.\
The following policy gives everyone in AWS access to everything in the queue called **MyTestQueue**:

```json
{
  "Version": "2008-10-17",
  "Id": "__default_policy_ID",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "__owner_statement",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "*"
      },
      "Action": ["SQS:*"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:123123123123:MyTestQueue"
    }
  ]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> You could even **trigger a Lambda in the attackers account every-time a new message** is put in the queue (you would need to re-put it) somehow. For this follow these instructinos: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs-cross-account-example.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs-cross-account-example.html)
