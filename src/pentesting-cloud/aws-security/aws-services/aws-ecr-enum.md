## ECR

### Basic Information

Amazon **Elastic Container Registry** (Amazon ECR) is a **managed container image registry service**. It is designed to provide an environment where customers can interact with their container images using well-known interfaces. Specifically, the use of the Docker CLI or any preferred client is supported, enabling activities such as pushing, pulling, and managing container images.

ECR is compose by 2 types of objects: **Registries** and **Repositories**.

**Registries**

Every AWS account has 2 registries: **Private** & **Public**.

1. **Private Registries**:

- **Private by default**: The container images stored in an Amazon ECR private registry are **only accessible to authorized users** within your AWS account or to those who have been granted permission.
  - The URI of a **private repository** follows the format `<account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<repo-name>`
- **Access control**: You can **control access** to your private container images using **IAM policies**, and you can configure fine-grained permissions based on users or roles.
- **Integration with AWS services**: Amazon ECR private registries can be easily **integrated with other AWS services**, such as EKS, ECS...
- **Other private registry options**:
  - The Tag immutability column lists its status, if tag immutability is enabled it will **prevent** image **pushes** with **pre-existing tags** from overwriting the images.
  - The **Encryption type** column lists the encryption properties of the repository, it shows the default encryption types such as AES-256, or has **KMS** enabled encryptions.
  - The **Pull through cache** column lists its status, if Pull through cache status is Active it will cache **repositories in an external public repository into your private repository**.
  - Specific **IAM policies** can be configured to grant different **permissions**.
  - The **scanning configuration** allows to scan for vulnerabilities in the images stored inside the repo.

2. **Public Registries**:

- **Public accessibility**: Container images stored in an ECR Public registry are **accessible to anyone on the internet without authentication.**
  - The URI of a **public repository** is like `public.ecr.aws/<random>/<name>`. Although the `<random>` part can be changed by the admin to another string easier to remember.

**Repositories**

These are the **images** that in the **private registry** or to the **public** one.

> [!NOTE]
> Note that in order to upload an image to a repository, the **ECR repository need to have the same name as the image**.

#### Registry & Repository Policies

**Registries & repositories** also have **policies that can be used to grant permissions to other principals/accounts**. For example, in the following repository policy image you can see how any user from the whole organization will be able to access the image:

### Enumeration

```bash
# Get repos
aws ecr describe-repositories
aws ecr describe-registry

# Get image metadata
aws ecr list-images --repository-name <repo_name>
aws ecr describe-images --repository-name <repo_name>
aws ecr describe-image-replication-status --repository-name <repo_name> --image-id <image_id>
aws ecr describe-image-scan-findings --repository-name <repo_name> --image-id <image_id>
aws ecr describe-pull-through-cache-rules --repository-name <repo_name> --image-id <image_id>

# Get public repositories
aws ecr-public describe-repositories

# Get policies
aws ecr get-registry-policy
aws ecr get-repository-policy --repository-name <repo_name>
```
