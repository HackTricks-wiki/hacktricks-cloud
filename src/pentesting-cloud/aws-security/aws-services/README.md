## Types of services

### Container services

Services that fall under container services have the following characteristics:

- The service itself runs on **separate infrastructure instances**, such as EC2.
- **AWS** is responsible for **managing the operating system and the platform**.
- A managed service is provided by AWS, which is typically the service itself for the **actual application which are seen as containers**.
- As a user of these container services, you have a number of management and security responsibilities, including **managing network access security, such as network access control list rules and any firewalls**.
- Also, platform-level identity and access management where it exists.
- **Examples** of AWS container services include Relational Database Service, Elastic Mapreduce, and Elastic Beanstalk.

### Abstract Services

- These services are **removed, abstracted, from the platform or management layer which cloud applications are built on**.
- The services are accessed via endpoints using AWS application programming interfaces, APIs.
- The **underlying infrastructure, operating system, and platform is managed by AWS**.
- The abstracted services provide a multi-tenancy platform on which the underlying infrastructure is shared.
- **Data is isolated via security mechanisms**.
- Abstract services have a strong integration with IAM, and **examples** of abstract services include S3, DynamoDB, Amazon Glacier, and SQS.
