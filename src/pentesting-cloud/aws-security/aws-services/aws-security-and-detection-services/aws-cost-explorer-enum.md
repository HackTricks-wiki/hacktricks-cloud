## Cost Explorer and Anomaly detection

This allows you to check **how are you expending money in AWS services** and help you **detecting anomalies**.\
Moreover, you can configure an anomaly detection so AWS will warn you when some a**nomaly in costs is found**.

### Budgets

Budgets help to **manage costs and usage**. You can get **alerted when a threshold is reached**.\
Also, they can be used for non cost related monitoring like the usage of a service (how many GB are used in a particular S3 bucket?).
