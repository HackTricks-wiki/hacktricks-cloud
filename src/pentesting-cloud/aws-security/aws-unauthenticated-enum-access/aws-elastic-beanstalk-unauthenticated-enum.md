## Elastic Beanstalk

For more information check:

### Web vulnerability

Note that by default Beanstalk environments have the **Metadatav1 disabled**.

The format of the Beanstalk web pages is **`https://<webapp-name>-env.<region>.elasticbeanstalk.com/`**

### Insecure Security Group Rules

Misconfigured security group rules can expose Elastic Beanstalk instances to the public. **Overly permissive ingress rules, such as allowing traffic from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0) on sensitive ports, can enable attackers to access the instance**.

### Publicly Accessible Load Balancer

If an Elastic Beanstalk environment uses a load balancer and the load balancer is configured to be publicly accessible, attackers can **send requests directly to the load balancer**. While this might not be an issue for web applications intended to be publicly accessible, it could be a problem for private applications or environments.

### Publicly Accessible S3 Buckets

Elastic Beanstalk applications are often stored in S3 buckets before deployment. If the S3 bucket containing the application is publicly accessible, an attacker could **download the application code and search for vulnerabilities or sensitive information**.

### Enumerate Public Environments

```bash
aws elasticbeanstalk describe-environments --query 'Environments[?OptionSettings[?OptionName==`aws:elbv2:listener:80:defaultProcess` && contains(OptionValue, `redirect`)]].{EnvironmentName:EnvironmentName, ApplicationName:ApplicationName, Status:Status}' --output table
```
