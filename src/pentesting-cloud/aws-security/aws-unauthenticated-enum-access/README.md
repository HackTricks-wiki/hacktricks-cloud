## AWS Credentials Leaks

A common way to obtain access or information about an AWS account is by **searching for leaks**. You can search for leaks using **google dorks**, checking the **public repos** of the **organization** and the **workers** of the organization in **Github** or other platforms, searching in **credentials leaks databases**... or in any other part you think you might find any information about the company and its cloud infa.\

## AWS Unauthenticated Enum & Access

## Cross Account Attacks

In the talk [**Breaking the Isolation: Cross-Account AWS Vulnerabilities**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfEFIcpJ2wk) it's presented how some services allow(ed) any AWS account accessing them because **AWS services without specifying accounts ID** were allowed.

During the talk they specify several examples, such as S3 buckets **allowing cloudtrai**l (of **any AWS** account) to **write to them**:

Other services found vulnerable:

- AWS Config
- Serverless repository

## Tools

- [**cloud_enum**](https://github.com/initstring/cloud_enum): Multi-cloud OSINT tool. **Find public resources** in AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Supported AWS services: Open / Protected S3 Buckets, awsapps (WorkMail, WorkDocs, Connect, etc.)
