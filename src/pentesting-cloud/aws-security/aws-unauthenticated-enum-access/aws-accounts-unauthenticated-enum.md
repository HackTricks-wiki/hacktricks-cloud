# AWS - Accounts Unauthenticated Enum

{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## Account IDs

If you have a target there are ways to try to identify account IDs of accounts related to the target.

### Brute-Force

You create a list of potential account IDs and aliases and check them

```bash
# Check if an account ID exists
curl -v https://<acount_id>.signin.aws.amazon.com
## If response is 404 it doesn't, if 200, it exists
## It also works from account aliases
curl -v https://vodafone-uk2.signin.aws.amazon.com
```

You can [automate this process with this tool](https://github.com/dagrz/aws_pwn/blob/master/reconnaissance/validate_accounts.py).

### OSINT

Look for urls that contains `<alias>.signin.aws.amazon.com` with an **alias related to the organization**.

### Marketplace

If a vendor has **instances in the marketplace,** you can get the owner id (account id) of the AWS account he used.

### Snapshots

- Public EBS snapshots (EC2 -> Snapshots -> Public Snapshots)
- RDS public snapshots (RDS -> Snapshots -> All Public Snapshots)
- Public AMIs (EC2 -> AMIs -> Public images)

### Errors

Many AWS error messages (even access denied) will give that information.
