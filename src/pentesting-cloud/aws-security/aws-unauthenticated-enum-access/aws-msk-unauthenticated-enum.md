### Public Port

It's possible to **expose the Kafka broker to the public**, but you will need **credentials**, IAM permissions or a valid certificate (depending on the auth method configured).

It's also **possible to disabled authentication**, but in that case **it's not possible to directly expose** the port to the Internet.

### Public URL template

```
b-{1,2,3,4}.{user_provided}.{random_id}.c{1,2}.kafka.{region}.amazonaws.com
{user_provided}.{random_id}.c{1,2}.kafka.useast-1.amazonaws.com
```
