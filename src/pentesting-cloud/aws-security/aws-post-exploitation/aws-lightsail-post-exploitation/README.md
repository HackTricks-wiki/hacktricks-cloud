### Restore old DB snapshots

If the DB is having snapshots, you might be able to **find sensitive information currently deleted in old snapshots**. **Restore** the snapshot in a **new database** and check it.

### Restore Instance Snapshots

Instance snapshots might contain **sensitive information** of already deleted instances or sensitive info that is deleted in the current instance. **Create new instances from the snapshots** and check them.\
Or **export the snapshot to an AMI in EC2** and follow the steps of a typical EC2 instance.

### Access Sensitive Information

Check out the Lightsail privesc options to learn different ways to access potential sensitive information:
