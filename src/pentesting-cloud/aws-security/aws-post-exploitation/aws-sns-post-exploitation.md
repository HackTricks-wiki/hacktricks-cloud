### Disrupt Messages

In several cases, SNS topics are used to send messages to platforms that are being monitored (emails, slack messages...). If an attacker prevents sending the messages that alert about it presence in the cloud, he could remain undetected.

### `sns:DeleteTopic`

An attacker could delete an entire SNS topic, causing message loss and impacting applications relying on the topic.

```bash
aws sns delete-topic --topic-arn <value>
```

**Potential Impact**: Message loss and service disruption for applications using the deleted topic.

### `sns:Publish`

An attacker could send malicious or unwanted messages to the SNS topic, potentially causing data corruption, triggering unintended actions, or exhausting resources.

```bash
aws sns publish --topic-arn <value> --message <value>
```

**Potential Impact**: Data corruption, unintended actions, or resource exhaustion.

### `sns:SetTopicAttributes`

An attacker could modify the attributes of an SNS topic, potentially affecting its performance, security, or availability.

```bash
aws sns set-topic-attributes --topic-arn <value> --attribute-name <value> --attribute-value <value>
```

**Potential Impact**: Misconfigurations leading to degraded performance, security issues, or reduced availability.

### `sns:Subscribe` , `sns:Unsubscribe`

An attacker could subscribe or unsubscribe to an SNS topic, potentially gaining unauthorized access to messages or disrupting the normal functioning of applications relying on the topic.

```bash
aws sns subscribe --topic-arn <value> --protocol <value> --endpoint <value>
aws sns unsubscribe --subscription-arn <value>
```

**Potential Impact**: Unauthorized access to messages, service disruption for applications relying on the affected topic.

### `sns:AddPermission` , `sns:RemovePermission`

An attacker could grant unauthorized users or services access to an SNS topic, or revoke permissions for legitimate users, causing disruptions in the normal functioning of applications that rely on the topic.

```css
aws sns add-permission --topic-arn <value> --label <value> --aws-account-id <value> --action-name <value>
aws sns remove-permission --topic-arn <value> --label <value>
```

**Potential Impact**: Unauthorized access to the topic, message exposure, or topic manipulation by unauthorized users or services, disruption of normal functioning for applications relying on the topic.

### `sns:TagResource` , `sns:UntagResource`

An attacker could add, modify, or remove tags from SNS resources, disrupting your organization's cost allocation, resource tracking, and access control policies based on tags.

```bash
aws sns tag-resource --resource-arn <value> --tags Key=<key>,Value=<value>
aws sns untag-resource --resource-arn <value> --tag-keys <key>
```

**Potential Impact**: Disruption of cost allocation, resource tracking, and tag-based access control policies.
