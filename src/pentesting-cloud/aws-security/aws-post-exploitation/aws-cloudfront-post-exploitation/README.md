### `cloudfront:Delete*`
An attacker granted cloudfront:Delete* can delete distributions, policies and other critical CDN configuration objects â€” for example distributions, cache/origin policies, key groups, origin access identities, functions/configs, and related resources. This can cause service disruption, content loss, and removal of configuration or forensic artifacts.

To delete a distribution an attacker could use:

```bash
aws cloudfront delete-distribution \
  --id <DISTRIBUTION_ID> \
  --if-match <ETAG>
```

### Man-in-the-Middle

This [**blog post**](https://medium.com/@adan.alvarez/how-attackers-can-misuse-aws-cloudfront-access-to-make-it-rain-cookies-acf9ce87541c) proposes a couple of different scenarios where a **Lambda** could be added (or modified if it's already being used) into a **communication through CloudFront** with the purpose of **stealing** user information (like the session **cookie**) and **modifying** the **response** (injecting a malicious JS script).

#### scenario 1: MitM where CloudFront is configured to access some HTML of a bucket

- **Create** the malicious **function**.
- **Associate** it with the CloudFront distribution.
- Set the **event type to "Viewer Response"**.

Accessing the response you could steal the users cookie and inject a malicious JS.

#### scenario 2: MitM where CloudFront is already using a lambda function

- **Modify the code** of the lambda function to steal sensitive information

You can check the [**tf code to recreate this scenarios here**](https://github.com/adanalvarez/AWS-Attack-Scenarios/tree/main).
