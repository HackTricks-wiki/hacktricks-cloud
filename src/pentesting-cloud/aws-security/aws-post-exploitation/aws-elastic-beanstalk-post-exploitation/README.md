### `elasticbeanstalk:DeleteApplicationVersion`

> [!NOTE]
> TODO: Test if more permissions are required for this

An attacker with the permission `elasticbeanstalk:DeleteApplicationVersion` can **delete an existing application version**. This action could disrupt application deployment pipelines or cause loss of specific application versions if not backed up.

```bash
aws elasticbeanstalk delete-application-version --application-name my-app --version-label my-version
```

**Potential Impact**: Disruption of application deployment and potential loss of application versions.

### `elasticbeanstalk:TerminateEnvironment`

> [!NOTE]
> TODO: Test if more permissions are required for this

An attacker with the permission `elasticbeanstalk:TerminateEnvironment` can **terminate an existing Elastic Beanstalk environment**, causing downtime for the application and potential data loss if the environment is not configured for backups.

```bash
aws elasticbeanstalk terminate-environment --environment-name my-existing-env
```

**Potential Impact**: Downtime of the application, potential data loss, and disruption of services.

### `elasticbeanstalk:DeleteApplication`

> [!NOTE]
> TODO: Test if more permissions are required for this

An attacker with the permission `elasticbeanstalk:DeleteApplication` can **delete an entire Elastic Beanstalk application**, including all its versions and environments. This action could cause a significant loss of application resources and configurations if not backed up.

```bash
aws elasticbeanstalk delete-application --application-name my-app --terminate-env-by-force
```

**Potential Impact**: Loss of application resources, configurations, environments, and application versions, leading to service disruption and potential data loss.

### `elasticbeanstalk:SwapEnvironmentCNAMEs`

> [!NOTE]
> TODO: Test if more permissions are required for this

An attacker with the `elasticbeanstalk:SwapEnvironmentCNAMEs` permission can **swap the CNAME records of two Elastic Beanstalk environments**, which might cause the wrong version of the application to be served to users or lead to unintended behavior.

```bash
aws elasticbeanstalk swap-environment-cnames --source-environment-name my-env-1 --destination-environment-name my-env-2
```

**Potential Impact**: Serving the wrong version of the application to users or causing unintended behavior in the application due to swapped environments.

### `elasticbeanstalk:AddTags`, `elasticbeanstalk:RemoveTags`

> [!NOTE]
> TODO: Test if more permissions are required for this

An attacker with the `elasticbeanstalk:AddTags` and `elasticbeanstalk:RemoveTags` permissions can **add or remove tags on Elastic Beanstalk resources**. This action could lead to incorrect resource allocation, billing, or resource management.

```bash
aws elasticbeanstalk add-tags --resource-arn arn:aws:elasticbeanstalk:us-west-2:123456789012:environment/my-app/my-env --tags Key=MaliciousTag,Value=1

aws elasticbeanstalk remove-tags --resource-arn arn:aws:elasticbeanstalk:us-west-2:123456789012:environment/my-app/my-env --tag-keys MaliciousTag
```

**Potential Impact**: Incorrect resource allocation, billing, or resource management due to added or removed tags.
