# AWS - EBS Privesc

## EBS

### `ebs:ListSnapshotBlocks`, `ebs:GetSnapshotBlock`, `ec2:DescribeSnapshots`

An attacker with those will be able to potentially **download and analyze volumes snapshots locally** and search for sensitive information in them (like secrets or source code). Find how to do this in:

../../aws-post-exploitation/aws-ec2-ebs-ssm-and-vpc-post-exploitation/aws-ebs-snapshot-dump.md
{{#endref}}

Other permissions might be also useful such as: `ec2:DescribeInstances`, `ec2:DescribeVolumes`, `ec2:DeleteSnapshot`, `ec2:CreateSnapshot`, `ec2:CreateTags`

The tool [https://github.com/Static-Flow/CloudCopy](https://github.com/Static-Flow/CloudCopy) performs this attack to e**xtract passwords from a domain controller**.

**Potential Impact:** Indirect privesc by locating sensitive information in the snapshot (you could even get Active Directory passwords).

### **`ec2:CreateSnapshot`**

Any AWS user possessing the **`EC2:CreateSnapshot`** permission can steal the hashes of all domain users by creating a **snapshot of the Domain Controller** mounting it to an instance they control and **exporting the NTDS.dit and SYSTEM** registry hive file for use with Impacket's secretsdump project.

You can use this tool to automate the attack: [https://github.com/Static-Flow/CloudCopy](https://github.com/Static-Flow/CloudCopy) or you could use one of the previous techniques after creating a snapshot.
