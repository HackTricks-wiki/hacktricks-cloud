## MSK

For more information about MSK (Kafka) check:

### `msk:ListClusters`, `msk:UpdateSecurity`

With these **privileges** and **access to the VPC where the kafka brokers are**, you could add the **None authentication** to access them.

```bash
aws msk --client-authentication <value> --cluster-arn <value> --current-version <value>
```

You need access to the VPC because **you cannot enable None authentication with Kafka publicly** exposed. If it's publicly exposed, if **SASL/SCRAM** authentication is used, you could **read the secret** to access (you will need additional privileges to read the secret).\
If **IAM role-based authentication** is used and **kafka is publicly exposed** you could still abuse these privileges to give you permissions to access it.
