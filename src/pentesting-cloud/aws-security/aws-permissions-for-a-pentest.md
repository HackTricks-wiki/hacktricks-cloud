# AWS - Permissions for a Pentest

{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

These are the permissions you need on each AWS account you want to audit to be able to run all the proposed AWS audit tools:

- The default policy **arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/**[**ReadOnlyAccess**](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadOnlyAccess)
- To run [aws_iam_review](https://github.com/carlospolop/aws_iam_review) you also need the permissions:
  - **access-analyzer:List\***
  - **access-analyzer:Get\***
  - **iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole**
  - **access-analyzer:CreateAnalyzer**
    - Optional if the client generates the analyzers for you, but usually it's easier just to ask for this permission)
  - **access-analyzer:DeleteAnalyzer**
    - Optional if the client removes the analyzers for you, but usually it's easier just to ask for this permission)
