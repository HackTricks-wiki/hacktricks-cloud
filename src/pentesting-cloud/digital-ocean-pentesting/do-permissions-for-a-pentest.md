# DO - Permissions for a Pentest

{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

DO doesn't support granular permissions. So the **minimum role** that allows a user to review all the resources is **member**. A pentester with this permission will be able to perform harmful activities, but it's what it's.
