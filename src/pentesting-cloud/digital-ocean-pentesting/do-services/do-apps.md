# DO - Apps

{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## Basic Information

[From the docs:](https://docs.digitalocean.com/glossary/app-platform/) App Platform is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering that allows developers to **publish code directly to DigitalOcean** servers without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

You can run code directly from **github**, **gitlab**, **docker hub**, **DO container registry** (or a sample app).

When defining an **env var** you can set it as **encrypted**. The only way to **retreive** its value is executing **commands** inside the host runnig the app.

An **App URL** looks like this [https://dolphin-app-2tofz.ondigitalocean.app](https://dolphin-app-2tofz.ondigitalocean.app)

### Enumeration

```bash
doctl apps list # You should get URLs here
doctl apps spec get <app-id> # Get yaml (including env vars, might be encrypted)
doctl apps logs <app-id> # Get HTTP logs
doctl apps list-alerts <app-id> # Get alerts
doctl apps list-regions # Get available regions and the default one
```

> [!CAUTION]
> **Apps doesn't have metadata endpoint**

### RCE & Encrypted env vars

To execute code directly in the container executing the App you will need **access to the console** and go to **`https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/<app-id>/console/<app-name>`**.

That will give you a **shell**, and just executing **`env`** you will be able to see **all the env vars** (including the ones defined as **encrypted**).
