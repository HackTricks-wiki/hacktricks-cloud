# DO - Functions

{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## Basic Information

DigitalOcean Functions, also known as "DO Functions," is a serverless computing platform that lets you **run code without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure**. With DO Functions, you can write and deploy your code as "functions" that can be **triggered** via **API**, **HTTP requests** (if enabled) or **cron**. These functions are executed in a fully managed environment, so you **don't need to worry** about scaling, security, or maintenance.

In DO, to create a function first you need to **create a namespace** which will be **grouping functions**.\
Inside the namespace you can then create a function.

### Triggers

The way **to trigger a function via REST API** (always enabled, it's the method the cli uses) is by triggering a request with an **authentication token** like:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://faas-lon1-129376a7.doserverless.co/api/v1/namespaces/fn-c100c012-65bf-4040-1230-2183764b7c23/actions/functionname?blocking=true&result=true" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic MGU0NTczZGQtNjNiYS00MjZlLWI2YjctODk0N2MyYTA2NGQ4OkhwVEllQ2t4djNZN2x6YjJiRmFGc1FERXBySVlWa1lEbUxtRE1aRTludXA1UUNlU2VpV0ZGNjNqWnVhYVdrTFg="
```

To see how is the **`doctl`** cli tool getting this token (so you can replicate it), the **following command shows the complete network trace:**

```bash
doctl serverless connect --trace
```

**When HTTP trigger is enabled**, a web function can be invoked through these **HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD and OPTIONS**.

> [!CAUTION]
> In DO functions, **environment variables cannot be encrypted** (at the time of this writing).\
> I couldn't find any way to read them from the CLI but from the console it's straight forward.

**Functions URLs** look like this: `https://<random>.doserverless.co/api/v1/web/<namespace-id>/default/<function-name>`

### Enumeration

```bash
# Namespace
doctl serverless namespaces list

# Functions (need to connect to a namespace)
doctl serverless connect
doctl serverless functions list
doctl serverless functions invoke <func-name>
doctl serverless functions get <func-name>

# Logs of executions
doctl serverless activations list
doctl serverless activations get <activation-id> # Get all the info about execution
doctl serverless activations logs <activation-id> # get only the logs of execution
doctl serverless activations result <activation-id> # get only the response result of execution

# I couldn't find any way to get the env variables form the CLI
```

> [!CAUTION]
> There **isn't metadata endpoint** from the Functions sandbox.
