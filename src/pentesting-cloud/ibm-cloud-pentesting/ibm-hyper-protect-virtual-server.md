# IBM - Hyper Protect Virtual Server

{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## Basic Information

Hyper Protect Virtual Server is a **virtual server** offering from IBM that is designed to provide a **high level of security and compliance** for sensitive workloads. It runs on **IBM Z and LinuxONE hardware**, which are designed for high levels of security and scalability.

Hyper Protect Virtual Server uses **advanced security features** such as secure boot, encrypted memory, and tamper-proof virtualization to protect sensitive data and applications. It also provides a **secure execution environment that isolates each workload from other workloads** running on the same system.

This virtual server offering is designed for workloads that require the highest levels of security and compliance, such as financial services, healthcare, and government. It allows organizations to run their sensitive workloads in a virtual environment while still meeting strict security and compliance requirements.

### Metadata & VPC

When you run a server like this one from the IBM service called "Hyper Protect Virtual Server" it **won't** allow you to configure **access to metadata,** link any **trusted profile**, use **user data**, or even a **VPC** to place the server in.

However, it's possible to **run a VM in a IBM Z linuxONE hardware** from the service "**Virtual server for VPC**" which will allow you to **set those configs** (metadata, trusted profiles, VPC...).

### IBM Z and LinuxONE

If you don't understand this terms chatGPT can help you understanding them.

**IBM Z is a family of mainframe computers** developed by IBM. These systems are designed for **high-performance, high-availability, and high-security** enterprise computing. IBM Z is known for its ability to handle large-scale transactions and data processing workloads.

**LinuxONE is a line of IBM Z** mainframes that are optimized for **running Linux** workloads. LinuxONE systems support a wide range of open-source software, tools, and applications. They provide a highly secure and scalable platform for running mission-critical workloads such as databases, analytics, and machine learning.

**LinuxONE** is built on the **same hardware** platform as **IBM Z**, but it is **optimized** for **Linux** workloads. LinuxONE systems support multiple virtual servers, each of which can run its own instance of Linux. These virtual servers are isolated from each other to ensure maximum security and reliability.

### LinuxONE vs x64

LinuxONE is a family of mainframe computers developed by IBM that are optimized for running Linux workloads. These systems are designed for high levels of security, reliability, scalability, and performance.

Compared to x64 architecture, which is the most common architecture used in servers and personal computers, LinuxONE has some unique advantages. Some of the key differences are:

1. **Scalability**: LinuxONE can support massive amounts of processing power and memory, which makes it ideal for large-scale workloads.
2. **Security**: LinuxONE has built-in security features that are designed to protect against cyber threats and data breaches. These features include hardware encryption, secure boot, and tamper-proof virtualization.
3. **Reliability**: LinuxONE has built-in redundancy and failover capabilities that help ensure high availability and minimize downtime.
4. **Performance**: LinuxONE can deliver high levels of performance for workloads that require large amounts of processing power, such as big data analytics, machine learning, and AI.

Overall, LinuxONE is a powerful and secure platform that is well-suited for running large-scale, mission-critical workloads that require high levels of performance and reliability. While x64 architecture has its own advantages, it may not be able to provide the same level of scalability, security, and reliability as LinuxONE for certain workloads.\\
