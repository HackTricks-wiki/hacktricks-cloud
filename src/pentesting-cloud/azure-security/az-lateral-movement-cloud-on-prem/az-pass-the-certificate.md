## Pass the Certificate (Azure)

In Azure joined machines, it's possible to authenticate from one machine to another using certificates that **must be issued by Entra ID CA** for the required user (as the subject) when both machines support the **NegoEx** authentication mechanism.

In super simplified terms:

- The machine (client) initiating the connection **needs a certificate from Entra ID for a user**.
- Client creates a JSON Web Token (JWT) header containing PRT and other details, sign it using the Derived key (using the session key and the security context) and **sends it to Entra ID**
- Entra ID verifies the JWT signature using client session key and security context, checks validity of PRT and **responds** with the **certificate**.

In this scenario and after grabbing all the info needed for a [**Pass the PRT**](az-primary-refresh-token-prt.md) attack:

- Username
- Tenant ID
- PRT
- Security context
- Derived Key

It's possible to **request P2P certificate** for the user with the tool [**PrtToCert**](https://github.com/morRubin/PrtToCert)**:**

```bash
RequestCert.py [-h] --tenantId TENANTID --prt PRT --userName USERNAME --hexCtx HEXCTX --hexDerivedKey HEXDERIVEDKEY [--passPhrase PASSPHRASE]
```

The certificates will last the same as the PRT. To use the certificate you can use the python tool [**AzureADJoinedMachinePTC**](https://github.com/morRubin/AzureADJoinedMachinePTC) that will **authenticate** to the remote machine, run **PSEXEC** and **open a CMD** on the victim machine. This will allow us to use Mimikatz again to get the PRT of another user.

```bash
Main.py [-h] --usercert USERCERT --certpass CERTPASS --remoteip REMOTEIP
```
