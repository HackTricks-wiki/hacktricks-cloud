# Az AD Connect - Hybrid Identity

{{#include ../../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## Basic Information

Integration between **On-premises Active Directory (AD)** and **Azure AD** is facilitated by **Azure AD Connect**, offering various methods that support **Single Sign-on (SSO)**. Each method, while useful, presents potential security vulnerabilities that could be exploited to compromise cloud or on-premises environments:

- **Pass-Through Authentication (PTA)**:
  - Possible compromise of the agent on the on-prem AD, allowing validation of user passwords for Azure connections (on-prem to Cloud).
  - Feasibility of registering a new agent to validate authentications in a new location (Cloud to on-prem).

- **Password Hash Sync (PHS)**:
  - Potential extraction of clear-text passwords of privileged users from the AD, including credentials of a high-privileged, auto-generated AzureAD user.

- **Federation**:
  - Theft of the private key used for SAML signing, enabling impersonation of on-prem and cloud identities.

- **Seamless SSO:**
  - Theft of the `AZUREADSSOACC` user's password, used for signing Kerberos silver tickets, allowing impersonation of any cloud user.

- **Cloud Kerberos Trust**:
  - Possibility of escalating from Global Admin to on-prem Domain Admin by manipulating AzureAD user usernames and SIDs and requesting TGTs from AzureAD.

- **Default Applications**:
  - Compromising an Application Administrator account or the on-premise Sync Account allows modification of directory settings, group memberships, user accounts, SharePoint sites, and OneDrive files.

For each integration method, user synchronization is conducted, and an `MSOL_<installationidentifier>` account is created in the on-prem AD. Notably, both **PHS** and **PTA** methods facilitate **Seamless SSO**, enabling automatic sign-in for Azure AD computers joined to the on-prem domain.

To verify the installation of **Azure AD Connect**, the following PowerShell command, utilizing the **AzureADConnectHealthSync** module (installed by default with Azure AD Connect), can be used:

```powershell
Get-ADSyncConnector
```
