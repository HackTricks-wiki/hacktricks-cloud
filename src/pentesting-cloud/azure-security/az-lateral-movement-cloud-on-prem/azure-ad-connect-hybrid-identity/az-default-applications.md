The blog post discusses a privilege escalation vulnerability in Azure AD, allowing Application Admins or compromised On-Premise Sync Accounts to escalate privileges by assigning credentials to applications. The vulnerability, stemming from the "by-design" behavior of Azure AD's handling of applications and service principals, notably affects default Office 365 applications. Although reported, the issue is not considered a vulnerability by Microsoft due to documentation of the admin rights assignment behavior. The post provides detailed technical insights and advises regular reviews of service principal credentials in Azure AD environments.
