## RemoteAddr Bypass

This **[blog post](https://trustedsec.com/blog/azures-front-door-waf-wtf-ip-restriction-bypass)** explains how when you are configuring some network restrictions with Azure Front Door you can filter based on **`RemoteAddr`** or **`SocketAddr`**. Being the main difference that **`RemoteAddr`** actually uses the value from the **`X-Forwarded-For`** HTTP header making it very easy to bypass.

To bypass this rule automated tools can be used that **brute-force IP addresses** until it finds a valid one.

This is mentioned in the [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/web-application-firewall/afds/waf-front-door-configure-ip-restriction).
