### Common tricks

- Keep the access keys
- Generate SAS
  - User delegated are 7 days max

### Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/update && Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/deletePolicy/write

These permissions allows the user to modify blob service properties for the container delete retention feature, which enables or configures the retention period for deleted containers. These permissions can be used for maintaining persistence to provide a window of opportunity for the attacker to recover or manipulate deleted containers that should have been permanently removed and accessing sensitive information.

```bash
az storage account blob-service-properties update \
  --account-name <STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME> \
  --enable-container-delete-retention true \
  --container-delete-retention-days 100
```

### Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/read && Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listKeys/action

These permissions can lead to the attacker to modify the retention policies, restoring deleted data, and accessing sensitive information.

```bash
az storage blob service-properties delete-policy update \
  --account-name <STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME> \
  --enable true \
  --days-retained 100
```
