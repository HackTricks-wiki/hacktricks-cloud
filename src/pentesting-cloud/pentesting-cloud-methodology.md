# Pentesting Cloud Methodology

## Basic Methodology

Each cloud has its own peculiarities but in general there are a few **common things a pentester should check** when testing a cloud environment:

- **Benchmark checks**
  - This will help you **understand the size** of the environment and **services used**
  - It will allow you also to find some **quick misconfigurations** as you can perform most of this tests with **automated tools**
- **Services Enumeration**
  - You probably won't find much more misconfigurations here if you performed correctly the benchmark tests, but you might find some that weren't being looked for in the benchmark test.
  - This will allow you to know **what is exactly being used** in the cloud env
  - This will help a lot in the next steps
- **Check exposed assets**
  - This can be done during the previous section, you need to **find out everything that is potentially exposed** to the Internet somehow and how can it be accessed.
    - Here I'm taking **manually exposed infrastructure** like instances with web pages or other ports being exposed, and also about other **cloud managed services that can be configured** to be exposed (such as DBs or buckets)
  - Then you should check **if that resource can be exposed or not** (confidential information? vulnerabilities? misconfigurations in the exposed service?)
- **Check permissions**
  - Here you should **find out all the permissions of each role/user** inside the cloud and how are they used
    - Too **many highly privileged** (control everything) accounts? Generated keys not used?... Most of these check should have been done in the benchmark tests already
    - If the client is using OpenID or SAML or other **federation** you might need to ask them for further **information** about **how is being each role assigned** (it's not the same that the admin role is assigned to 1 user or to 100)
  - It's **not enough to find** which users has **admin** permissions "\*:\*". There are a lot of **other permissions** that depending on the services used can be very **sensitive**.
    - Moreover, there are **potential privesc** ways to follow abusing permissions. All this things should be taken into account and **as much privesc paths as possible** should be reported.
- **Check Integrations**
  - It's highly probably that **integrations with other clouds or SaaS** are being used inside the cloud env.
    - For **integrations of the cloud you are auditing** with other platform you should notify **who has access to (ab)use that integration** and you should ask **how sensitive** is the action being performed.\
      For example, who can write in an AWS bucket where GCP is getting data from (ask how sensitive is the action in GCP treating that data).
    - For **integrations inside the cloud you are auditing** from external platforms, you should ask **who has access externally to (ab)use that integration** and check how is that data being used.\
      For example, if a service is using a Docker image hosted in GCR, you should ask who has access to modify that and which sensitive info and access will get that image when executed inside an AWS cloud.

## Multi-Cloud tools

There are several tools that can be used to test different cloud environments. The installation steps and links are going to be indicated in this section.

### [PurplePanda](https://github.com/carlospolop/purplepanda)

A tool to **identify bad configurations and privesc path in clouds and across clouds/SaaS.**

- file_path: ""
  service_account_id: "some-sa-email@sidentifier.iam.gserviceaccount.com"' | base64)

python3 main.py -a -p google #Get basic info of the account to check it's correctly configured
python3 main.py -e -p google #Enumerate the env
```

{{#endtab }}
{{#endtabs }}

### [Prowler](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler)

```

{{#endtab }}

{{#tab name="GCP" }}

```bash
scout gcp --report-dir /tmp/gcp --user-account --all-projects
## use "--service-account KEY_FILE" instead of "--user-account" to use a service account

SCOUT_FOLDER_REPORT="/tmp"
for pid in $(gcloud projects list --format="value(projectId)"); do
    echo "================================================"
    echo "Checking $pid"
    mkdir "$SCOUT_FOLDER_REPORT/$pid"
    scout gcp --report-dir "$SCOUT_FOLDER_REPORT/$pid" --no-browser --user-account --project-id "$pid"
done
```

{{#endtab }}
{{#endtabs }}

### [Steampipe](https://github.com/turbot)

{{#tabs }}
{{#tab name="Install" }}
Download and install Steampipe ([https://steampipe.io/downloads](https://steampipe.io/downloads)). Or use Brew:

```
brew tap turbot/tap
brew install steampipe
```

{{#endtab }}

{{#tab name="GCP" }}

```bash
# Install gcp plugin
steampipe plugin install gcp

# Use https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-gcp-compliance.git
git clone https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-gcp-compliance.git
cd steampipe-mod-gcp-compliance
# To run all the checks from the dashboard
steampipe dashboard
# To run all the checks from rhe cli
steampipe check all
```

<details>

<summary>Check all Projects</summary>

In order to check all the projects you need to generate the `gcp.spc` file indicating all the projects to test. You can just follow the indications from the following script

```bash
FILEPATH="/tmp/gcp.spc"
rm -rf "$FILEPATH" 2>/dev/null

# Generate a json like object for each project
for pid in $(gcloud projects list --format="value(projectId)"); do
echo "connection \"gcp_$(echo -n $pid | tr "-" "_" )\" {
    plugin  = \"gcp\"
    project = \"$pid\"
}" >> "$FILEPATH"
done

# Generate the aggragator to call
echo 'connection "gcp_all" {
  plugin      = "gcp"
  type        = "aggregator"
  connections = ["gcp_*"]
}' >> "$FILEPATH"

echo "Copy $FILEPATH in ~/.steampipe/config/gcp.spc if it was correctly generated"
```

### Attack Graph

[**Stormspotter** ](https://github.com/Azure/Stormspotter)creates an “attack graph” of the resources in an Azure subscription. It enables red teams and pentesters to visualize the attack surface and pivot opportunities within a tenant, and supercharges your defenders to quickly orient and prioritize incident response work.

### Office365

You need **Global Admin** or at least **Global Admin Reader** (but note that Global Admin Reader is a little bit limited). However, those limitations appear in some PS modules and can be bypassed accessing the features **via the web application**.
